Yesterday I went for a walk with a Garmin Etrex 32 that was sometimes in my hands and at other times in my pocket. I could have been hands three with a GPS watch but it's good to play with a variety of devices. I chose the Etrex because it was paired with the Tempe thermometer.
The Thermometer was in my backpack, in the top pocket. I knew that the air temperature would be around 30°c but I wanted to see what the "felt" temperature would be. As I left home the thermometer indicated 28°c before climbing to a maximum of 45°c and an average of 38°c.

I felt fine during this walk. I set off with a 600ml water bottle and for the first half of the walk I didn't drink because I wasn't thirsty. By the time I did start drinking my water it was warm.

## Walking to Fountains

The advantage of walking the same routes every day for years in a row, is that you learn where the water points are, even in a drought, and even when they turn off most of the fountains. I know of two fountains with drinking water. One of them is by a motorway stop, near a river. It's a fountain that is near a composting place for garden rubbish.
The second water fountain is down the road from Celigny, on a sleep climb, or descent, depending on your direction of travel. The flow from both of these fountains is slow, but on a hot day, when you're out of water, they're fine.
Other fountains run all year round but they have one serious flaw. They're not "potable". They are not certified "safe" for drinking. It's a shame that they don't tell us what makes these fountains unsafe, because If I knew then I could use one of my water filters to make them safe. I am not playing with water filters to clean water, when I don't know what I want to remove from it.
The Essential Hat
I never leave home without a hat. In winter it keeps me warm, but in summer it's to protect me from the sun. If I went for a walk, in conditions like the forecast heatwave, without a hat, then my hair, and head would overheat with speed. My head would have heated to 45°c yesterday, if I had not worn a hat, or been ready with drinking water. I drank 400 to 500ml on the way out. When I was on the return part of the walk I refilled my water bottle, and drank another 600ml.
Without a hat and water I would get heat stroke.

## The New Normal

A few years ago I found it nice, and luxurious to get 30°c heat in Switzerland. Occassionaly, when I was climbing, it would get to 40°c by the cliff face. When I had a broken arm I was walking in 37°c heat, and did so for the last few years. When I have a hat, and water, heat doesn't bother me, especially in the countryside
Heat Islands
I have been cycling on high temperature days and as long as I was riding, with the breeze blowing over me, I was fine. It's when I stopped, especially in the ovens of Geneva, and other towns, that I felt myself cook. Heat from the sun is one thing. Heat radiating from cement, tarmac and buildings is quite another.
The coolest place I often encounter is forests through which a stream runs. Usually the contrast between the two is clear and distinct. If you're too warm, on a warm day, head to a forest stream and you'll recover.

## Freedom From Dogs

One of the nicest feature of heatwaves is that the weather is too warm for dogs, so dogs stay indoors, where it's cooler. I have a fear of dogs, and when the heat waves hit I feel good, because I do not need to worry about encountering dog walkers. I can enjoy my walks fully.

## And Finally

For several summers my apartment was so warm that I was soaked, just sitting, doing nothing, and stepping outside into the heat, was actually an opportunity to cool down. As long as I have a hat, and water, I'm fine with the heat. Take away my hat, and water, and I will be like everyone else.
Remember, if you're too warm indoors, open a window to the outside, and the door from your room to the hallway. Create a breeze, and it will keep you cool.
