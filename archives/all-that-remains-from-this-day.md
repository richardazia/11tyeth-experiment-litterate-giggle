Today a friend of mine was in the news, after being arrested and released in China. He's a photographer. At the same time, I'm in England and I am no longer welcome to a place where I have spent many hours. I have three documents loaded within the browser to continue work on the dissertation proposal I am going to continue on within the next few minutes or within the next day or two. I'm going home in about 28 days or so, that's four weeks. I have a documentary meeting, a tutor meeting, and aÂ  multicamera meeting, all for around the same time. There is also a globalisation meeting. After that, I may go home and edit what should have been edited already. This depends on what's decided during one of the meetings. It's the daily life of a student.
