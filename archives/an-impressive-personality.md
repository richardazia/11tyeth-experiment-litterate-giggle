How many people have the ability to walk out in front of a crowd of hundreds and a televisual audience of several thousand? I don't think that many, especially not with the confidence of this young girl. If I understood her correctly her name is Johanna and she is from Romania. I was watching the footage of the Youth Eurovision song contest and when she came on stage I was surprised by the strength of character she displayed at such a young age. Of course, other people were on stage afterward to help with the show. I've only watched small fragments of the show but it's amusing to see young people perform. They have such ease and freedom.
