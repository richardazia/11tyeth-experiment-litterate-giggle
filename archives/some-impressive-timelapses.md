I'm back in Switzerland now and I've been around for a little over a day now. I can't be bothered going out so I'm watching one of the discovery earth documentaries and there's a really interesting series of plant time-lapses that have been included. They're used to illustrate what happens when a tree falls down and how the plants struggle with speed to take advantage of the increase in light.
