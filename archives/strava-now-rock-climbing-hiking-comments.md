Hey Richard. I actually built an app to solve this problem. I'm a climber and a runner and I wanted to be able to track my climbing and see all my exercise in one place. You can log your indoor climbs in the app and it lets you enter the grade, how many tops you completed and tailors everything to the specific gym you're in. There's no outdoor climbing yet but it's planned for the future. Check it out on https://www.clamberapp.com if you think it will help you.
