La chapelle D'abondance is a nice via ferrata split into three parts. The first part is not so hard, the second part is harder and the last part is meant to be very hard. The walk from the parking to the first section is short at around 15 minutes. The via ferrata itself took about 2hrs going with people whom had not yet practiced this sport. We did experience rain on this visit to the via ferrata so some of the rocks were slippy, as were the cables. This did not present such difficulties though. Here are some images from the trip. \[flickr-gallery mode="photoset" photoset="72157626727945869"\]
