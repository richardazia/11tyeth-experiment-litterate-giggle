PAF is not just the way you discribe something hitting something else. It is also used to define a portable application file. These are self contained executables that you can use for mobile versions of your favourite browser. ![chromo logo](http://www.google.com/intl/fr/images/logos/chrome_logo.gif "Chrome logo")One of my personal favourites at the moment is Chrome, it's fast, light, and behaves the way I want it to. Better still it incorporates flash into the code. This means that I can view flash content without it being installed on the computer I'm using.
