Today I went for a short walk in the Jura with minimal shoes and I felt fine. The shoes, despite being thin soled, felt fine on the dry dirt paths. They do get wet when walking in dew covered grass but that’s what you would expect so that’s acceptable. 

When you’re wearing minimal shoes you can be barefoot or with socks but both the shoes, and socks dry quickly when there is so little fabric. That’s the bonus of minimal shoes. The other benefit is that they’re light and responsive, so I felt comfortable for the entire walk. They feel natural. 

I walked with these shoes because I know the path well so I don’t worry about wondering into the unknown with shoes that are not adapted to the situation. The route is one that I know very well, thus the lack of concern about shoes.

Now is a good time to go to the mountains as there are thousands of flowers that have bloomed.

**The Two Cultures**

It was interesting to see the two shoe cultures today. On one side there was me, wearing thin, minimal shoes. On the other you had conventional shoes that offer a lot of cushioning. What’s interesting is that I noticed. Before wearing barefoot shoe wearing I saw a shoe as a shoe. Now I notice the difference and look and feel. 

The trail gloves felt great on the walk today. So thin and light and yet perfectly comfortable. I don’t know whether wearing vapor gloves, and then trail gloves has much effect on comfort levels. I really do feel happy with the trail gloves. They’re simple, comfortable shoes. The only question to answer, now, is whether they will last 800 km of walking or not. If they do then they are a good future option.
