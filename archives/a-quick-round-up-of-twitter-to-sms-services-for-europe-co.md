Two weeks after twitter gave up on Europe here are a number of services you can try out. [TweetSMS](http://www.TweetSMS.com ) This service should be launching this weekend and some people are already testing the service [3jam](http://www.3jam.com) It's up and running but requires for you to pay via paypal rather than Visa or other widely accepted cards [Twitmobile](http://www.twitmobile.com) So far not much information on the service but advertises 5p per message. Let's see when they're online [Hootsms](www.HootSMS.com) Hootsms are already up and running but as with other services you are required to pay via paypal. It allows a number of bulk buying SMS. You can buy up to a thousand sms for 50 GBP. [Zygotweet](http://www.zygotweet.com) Not much information so far. [Twittex](https://twittex.com/) Appears already to be up and running. If you've tried any of these services leave a comment below commenting on your experience with these services.
