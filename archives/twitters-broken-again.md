Yes, it's happened yet again, twitter is broken again but in an entirely new way. At first it appeared that twitter had crashed in the old way, that is to say no server response. This time is different though. We've got the WML website version showing. The mobile version is now on the web version. ![Twitter's broken again](http://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/twitterbroken.jpg) Does this mean we'll see the replies tab on twitter mobile? I really hope so. I want to see how people respond, no point in tweeting if you're not listening. Thanks twitter, for finding yet another interesting way in which to break. ---update--- nothing broke, same crap mobile interface as always.
