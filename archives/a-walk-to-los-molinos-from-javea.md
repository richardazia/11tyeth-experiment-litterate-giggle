This walk takes you from the Port of Javea up to the lighthouse near San Antonio before continuing along the top towards [Los Molinos](https://www.javea.com/molinos-de-la-plana/). These are old grain mills. They used wind power to grind grain for several centuries before being taken out of action as modernisation arrived.

The walk takes you along the port before you start to climb. As you walk along the port you will see a number of cats, either being lazy, or playing. You will then start to climb. The first few metres require some bigger steps but after that you will find that it gets easier. There is a good view over the port at several moments. You also get a good view of the sea.

View of the Mediterranean sea

On this walk I could hear the bees and other insects buzzing. You can also see that many young trees are coming up. Many of them were destroyed by a fire a few years ago. In a few more years this will be a walk in the shade, once more.

A year or two ago, we did this walk. We came across the old kiln. Due to rain and nature recovering though, the kiln is hidden once again. I don't remember if I have the GPS coordinates for the kiln. Nature will help keep it hidden and safe.

I tracked this walk with the CASIO GBD-200 and the Apple watch with the Steps app. The casio gave a good track although it did not track altitude and heart rate. The Steps app, with an outdoor walk, was crap. It didn't track heart rate for some reason which makes it crap. The Apple Fitness app says that I didn't burn my daily calorie goal today, as a result.

And Finally
-----------

This walk is quite easy, for those used to walking over rough terrain but it does come with seasonal difficulty variability. As soon as the weather gets warmer walking with enough water is important. You are exposed for at least an hour or three, dependent on how fast you walk. In 35°c heat you will cook. In 19°c you will feel comfortable. Consider this, before trying the walk.
