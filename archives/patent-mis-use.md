A [recent blog post](http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/08/07/more-lawsuit-fun-for-facebook/) is bringing people's attention to a group who want to sue Facebook for patent infringement. The problem with [this patent](http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?u=%2Fnetahtml%2Fsrchnum.htm&Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&p=1&r=1&l=50&f=G&d=PALL&s1=6519629.PN.&OS=PN/6519629&RS=PN/6519629) is that it is so broad in it's language that it would include almost all social networking websites.

> _An Information and Application Distribution System (IADS) is disclosed. The IADS operates, in one embodiment, to distribute, initiate and allow interaction and communication within like-minded communities. Application distribution occurs through the transmission and receipt of an "invitation application" which contains both a message component and an executable component to enable multiple users to connect within a specific community. The application object includes functionality which allows the user's local computer to automatically set up a user interface to connect with a central controller which facilitates interaction and introduction between and among users._

From what I understand as a non patent lawyer is that this patent is so broad in scope that it could include all social networking websites.
