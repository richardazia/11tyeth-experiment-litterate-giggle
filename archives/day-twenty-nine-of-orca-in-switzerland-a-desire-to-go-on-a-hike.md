We're in day 29 of ORCA in Switzerland and I have an ever increasing desire to go for a hike. During today's walk I listened to two podcasts about hiking and I walked yet another variant of my usual walk. Apple tree blooms are increasing in number and the Colza looks almost ready to harvest.

We're also going into a dry summer. During this pandemic we have hardly had any rain for a month. The whole of Switzerland is either yellow, orange or red with the risk of fire. I've been walking outdoors with a t-shirt.

We could be under the illusion that Switzerland has beaten the virus but that's an illusion, because the risk of a new center of contagion is possible. We have to continue self-isolating. Today two children cycled too close to me so I crossed to the opposite side of the road because they stopped and would pass me again.

When I posted Matt's ball pit bouldering photo my poor mother thought it was real and asked me how long it took to clean up all those balls. ?????

By the end of the walk today I started to feel tired. That didn't stop me from playing on a board fixed above a set of springs and working different muscles than I do when walking. I saw groups of people out, mostly in groups of two or three but I did spot a group of six as I started the group. It was young children and in theory we're in a less critical part of the curve.

If the shops are not busy I should get some more food tomorrow but I fear that the shops will be as busy as they were on Thursday and Saturday. If that is the case then I will wait until Wednesday.

If Thursday and Saturday are an indication of whether society has changed or not I would say that it hasn't, in the least. People still have to do things together, at the same time.

I apologise for this post being uninspired. Self-Isolation has become routine
