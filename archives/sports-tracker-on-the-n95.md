It's fun to walk fast and far, especially in the countryside where there are fewer people to avoid. I often walk for fourty minutes to an hour at the end of the day to think about the day and process all that's happened. Recently though I realised one of the shorter walks is almost 3000 steps thanks to the N95 pedometer. That's because with the N95 you have a built in GPS and the ability to download applications. One of these is the sports tracker that allows you to track a number of variables across four to six screens. There's the map view, map view with relevant details, co-ordinate view, speed view, pedometer and then three or four graphs, some for time in relation to speed, distance over time and height in relation to speed. You can zoom in and out of the graphs as you're walking. If you do this more than once it creates a series of tracks that you can easily translate to KML and importe to Google Earth so the world can see your walks. Of course keeping your privacy from some people may be desirable. It's a fun little addition to the n95 although the biggest drawback is you need to have it out in front of you to keep track of the satellites.
