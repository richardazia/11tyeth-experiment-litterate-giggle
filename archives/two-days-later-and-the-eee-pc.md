It's two days later and I'm close to touch typing on the asus eee and I'm enjoying the machine just as much. I did try to upgrade to openoffice 2.3.1 from 2.0 and no luck so far. As a result I'm stuck with relying on the cloud instead. One friend found the machine hard to type on. That's because with this type of keyboard your fingers are bigger than the keys. It's important to make sure you've pressed properly. For long documents it's still a challenge to use. For tweeting it's good.
