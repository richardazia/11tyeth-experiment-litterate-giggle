Friend in Austin finds wi-fi on her daily bus ride to/from work. Has to turn off the Airport wireless to avoid the networks popping up.

I recently had a similar idea, I also have a new N95 8GB and I noticed there's a lot of free Wi-Fi around Prague where I live. My first post to Ovi was about free Wi-Fi access I found: http://www.twango.com/media/PragueBob.public/PragueBob.10001 What do you think is the quickest way to share these findings, I didn't qunderstand what you meant by "including in the exif".
