With 3g and fast mobile broadband access on the horizon more and more people will be streaming their content live for those across the world to see. Of interest around Geneva in the next few days is the European cup. We may find a few more people than usual in the streets and this may be of interest to people.

You probably remember the football world cup. People were taking thousands of pictures and tagging them as world cup. Now with the European cup let's stream the enthusiasm people are showing locally. Let's take advantage of new technology.
