Today I went to try the new macbook pro and macbooks and I found that I prefered the macbook to the other device. I like that the keyboard is there and there's nothing to the side. it's a better feeling machine for when you move around. The biggest difference between these two machines and older models is the touchpad interface. Rather than have a seperate button and tactile area both are integrated. press down on the touchpad and you've got the same reaction as when you pressed the button. Use two fingers and you scroll. Use three fingers in apps like iphoto and you move from one picture to another. Use four fingers and there are three reactions. The first is when going up then down. It minimises the window, to the sides and it changes apps. Down and you go to see several windows. It's not as intuitive as it sounds. Whilst the trackpad is a nice idea I think it's going to take people some getting used to. At first it was really great but within a few minutes I would accidentaly drag things across, select something I didn't want to or other. In brief whilst it's meant to be intuitive it wasn't.
