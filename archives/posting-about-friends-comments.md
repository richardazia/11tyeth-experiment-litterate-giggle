For me, I like knowing their Twitter profile it says more about where they are at than where they have been or are heading to.

That's a very interesting question... I've been pondering it. :) I think for me, I tend to link to people's websites (when I'm referencing them in a blog post, for example), b/c their website or blog feels to me like the "living room" of their social-networking life. And then their site usually has links to everything else that they're doing online - i.e.: Twitter, Facebook, etc...
