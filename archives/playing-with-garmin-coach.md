Today I began playing with Garmin Coach. I decided to try one of the running programs. It's the first of January, first day of the year, and I have already been for two walks and a run. The run was a calibration run so I ran too fast and too hard so I burned out on the first task. I ran at 16km/h and 230 steps per minute for a short burst before tiring and slowing a bit.

In the end I did not reach the 5 minute mark, but only by 45 seconds or so. With a different gradient I probably would have made the five minute mark, as well as with a more rational pace. I was tricked. I read that I was meant to do a hard run to the maximum of my ability so I tried.

When I got home I saw that it said "a moderate pace" so I think I pushed too hard for the first run. Now I feel physically tired. That's due to the sound of fireworks for hours over the new year.

When you do a workout on the Garmin Instinct, without audio queues the watch asks "Do workout, you select yes, and it gives you the visual queues for when to warm up, run and rest. It then ends the workout but does not stop the track. This means that if you have to walk the rest of the way home, or to a car, you can, and it will be included in the workout.

That the watch displays workout information like this is practical because you don't need to count "from 0 to 2 minutes I do this, then from 2 to 5 I do that, etc. You simply say yes to the workout and that's enough. Next time I need to check audio queues from the watch, and another time, audio queues from the phone via earphones.

As I am just one workout in I have not formed a concrete opinion on the workout.
