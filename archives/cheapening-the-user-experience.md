There are a great diversity of websites out there and each one has it's own strengths. As a result of this it is not unusual for me to visit twenty to thirty websites on a daily basis, from the likes of twitter, my own website, news sites and more. What this means is that I find the tools that are best for what I want to do on a variety of websites. To each website it's own purpose. That's why I'm so dissapointed with what facebook has become at the moment. In the good old days of e-mail use you would start with a clean account and every e-mail you received you wanted. As a result you might get one or two e-mails every few days but they were of interest. Over time spammers started sending their junk and this personal space was less personal space. At around the same time friends began sending chainmail, participating on "which character are you most like" and other activities. As a result of this there was a lot of static which meant more time would be wasted processing the influx of information. This problem then came to social networking websites. One of the weaknesses of myspace was that everyone could put megabytes of junk on their pages and the website would slow down and crash certain browsers. In other situations people spam you via the bulletin boards in such way that you start to ignore them. I thought that facebook was different. I used to view facebook as a mature online community that was about people keeping in touch with their friends. The sharing of personal images, personal videos and personal work was great. That is, until the api came along. A I look at the daily requests on facebook I have zombies biting me, I have several application requests that do the same thing for music and more. The "questions for friends" api is one of those useless api that makes you sign into a service you don't want to use so that you can read the question a friend wants to ask you. The "compare me to my friends" api is another annoying one. Yesterday I noticed that I was more likely than someone else to do something and I signed up for the api, unselecting all the elements that would advertise the api to those in my news feed. I wanted to see whom I had been compared to but found out that I had to answer fifty questions before being able to use the api. At this point I removed the api. The beauty of the World Wide Web is the vast amount of specialised websites and tools that allow for the sharing of a variety of elements. If I want friends to know about my travels then I've got [World66](http://www.world66.com/), website I used before going to Poland. If I want to talk about good food and restaurants then I'll drop by [Trusted Places](http://trustedplaces.com/) and read what users have written. If I want to play games online then I'd go to [Kraland](http://kraland.org/), [nainwak](http://www.nainwak.com/), [travian](http://www.travian.co.uk/) and a number of other websites. I see Facebook as the modern version of the phonebook where I can keep up to date with what friends are doing and where they are geographically. I enjoy the ability to see photographs and videos of what they're doing but hate being spammed with movie trailers and other junk. I want facebook to be about my network of friends and what they're doing in the real world. If there is too much extraneous content then I shall be looking for a less populist website. The fact that it's been [banned in certain work environments](http://www.allfacebook.com/2007/08/facebook-banned-at-work/) demonstrates it's declining value as a social networking website.
