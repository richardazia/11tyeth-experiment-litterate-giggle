This week should see me dropping by the Frontline Club in London for the first time in weeks. I want to see [Blog Wars](http://www.frontlineclub.com/club_events.php?event=1544) which could be quite interesting. "Blog Wars provides a sharp and funny look at the explosion of political blogs, which have become the loudspeakers for a new generation of activists speaking out and picking fights across the political spectrum" I'm looking forward to yet another [Seesmic](http://www.seesmic.com) meetup and I've heard that some interesting people should be present although I haven't seen this written on paper yet. The usual London suspects should be there so that should be a really good evening. That will be on the 17th and more details are to follow. I'm not sure whether there's another [Social Media Cafe](http://Londonsocialmediacafe.pbwiki.com/Second%20Prototyping%20Meeting%20080111) but if there is then there's a very good chance I'll be present. I'll keep you informed.
