### The Manu Chao Concert

Manu Chao was on the Grande Scène at Paléo last night. His concert lasted for an energetic two hours. He kept saying"Vous êtes Fou, Paléo". He gave a lot of energy and so did the audience. For two hours he jumped around, for two hours the audience jumped around too. The sea of faces and people were impressive. In the distance you could see pac-man and a few ghosts bobbing up and down with the music. \[caption id="attachment\_3682" align="aligncenter" width="300"\][![The Manu Chao Sea of faces](https://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/IMG_3675-300x225.jpg)](https://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/IMG_3675.jpg) The Manu Chao Sea of faces\[/caption\]

### Online sharing has evolved

While I was at this year's Paléo two things were different. The first is that we now have unlimited data plans. When I was last at a Paléo Manu Chao concert we had limited data plans and it was a geeky thing to share to stream the event. Today you see that many people are sharing the event with their facebook friends. The other difference is that we are now capturing Paléo souvenirs in 4K and sharing panoramas with our friends.

### Panoramas

I tried creating panoramas during a few of the concerts. The image above was created with an Iphone SE and the inbuilt panorama function. It works well as long as you're lucky enough not to have sudden changes in light. \[caption id="attachment\_3684" align="aligncenter" width="1024"\][![Playing with panorama during another concert](https://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/IMG_3601-1024x240.jpg)](https://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/IMG_3601.jpg) Playing with panorama during another concert\[/caption\] I like panoramas because you're in control. You can pan the camera to see what you want to see. It's also a means by which to get context.

### Affinity Photo Panorama

[Affinity Photo](https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/photo/) is a photo editing software that I bought when it was on promotion. It has a panorama function to stitch multiple images together. During one concert I took a series of pictures looking up and down. When I got home I used the panorama function and this is the result. \[caption id="attachment\_3689" align="aligncenter" width="1024"\][![Photostitched Panorama](https://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/paleo1-small-1024x340.jpg)](https://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/paleo1-small.jpg) Photostitched Panorama\[/caption\]
