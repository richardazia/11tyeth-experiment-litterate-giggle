I saw a deer

What do I mean by such an odd combination of words? That today it was warm. 25Â°c at the time when I set off for my bike ride. It was warm enough to feel comfortable in summer cycling equipment. What was more unusual, for this time of year, is how dry the landscape is. The fields are dry. The sides of the road are dry. Grass lawns look dry, where they have been cut too short. It was a good day to cycle.

I finished [Learning Node.js](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-node-js-2017) and [Learning NPM Manager](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-npm-the-node-package-manager-2018). These are two courses that are now revision and consolidation, not new knowledge for me. I need them to get one of the learning pathways. I resumed [JavaScript Essential Training](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/javascript-essential-training). I took a break from the course because I wanted to revise some other knowledge before continuing with my progress. I am reviewing a few videos, to refresh and consolidate my understanding.

With cycling I use water bottles regularly and I find that they tend to get the smell of the drinks they contain and mouldy, no matter how careful you are. The mouth piece and the bottles themselves. I have experimented with some [camelbak podium](https://www.galaxus.ch/en/s3/product/camelbak-podium-062l-water-bottles-thermos-flasks-10868702) bottles today. If you look at modern sauce bottles you see that they require pressure for the seal to break and for sauce to come out. The same is true of these bottles. If you hold the bottle upside down it will not leak like other bottles. To make it leak you need to squeeze it. Alternatively suck and you'll get water.

This isn't a sip at a time though. This is like drinking from a tap, while you're riding a bike. It feels luxurious. It feels efficient.

What is of real interest to me is the ability to dismantle and clean everything properly. With other water bottles I could not reach the top of the bottle, or within the mechanism from which to drink. This one can be dismantled, cleaned, and remantled.
