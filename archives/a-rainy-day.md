I hate pandemic weekends because out of pandemic I would be free to do a lot. In pandemic I am not free to do those things.

I will write longer posts when i regain my healthy solitude.

Recently I have started forgetting my phone at home when I go out. I use it to take pictures and for the fitness apps but but not much more now that Twitter is gone and Mastodon and other alternatives are unpleasant.

Pandemics are not fun when youâ€™re surrounded by people living with the delusion that the pandemic is over. We have lived with that delusion for two years.
