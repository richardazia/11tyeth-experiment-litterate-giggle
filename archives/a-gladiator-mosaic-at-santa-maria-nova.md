I have walked more than once along the Via Appia but I don't remember seeing this mosaic. It shows a gladiator with a trident. The name of a gladiator equipped in this manner is [Retiarius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retiarius). Next time you are on the Appian Way consider visiting this Roman Villa, along with the various catacombs.
