The way we're consuming information has changed completely. i see the freesheets as doomed and look forward to the day when more and more people have ipod touch like devices. I want to see a world where you select the news and information you consume as you're on the room rather than before setting off. Already I've got a taste of the future (although to the occasional few it's the present). Apparently google is looking at an advertising model that would see kiosks print out magazines with [adverts tailored specifically](http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/11/19/google-magazine/) toÂ  the reader's needs. Personally I don't see the interest anymore as this seems like an old media strategy within a social media future. Most of the media I consume is in portable form, whether it's a podcast, video content or other. It's fed to me via RSS for processing at my own speed. Where is the relevance of such a patent when print is becoming less and less relevant?
