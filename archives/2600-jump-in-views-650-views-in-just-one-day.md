That's fun :-) [![](http://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/picture-23-300x232.png "picture-23")](http://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/picture-23.png) Thanks to the Geneva Lake Parade I saw a nice jump in traffic to the twelve videos or so I streamed and uploaded yesterday. I suppose when you cover the right event there is an audience. This is just one small example of why I should continue streaming video content. That's also why I should get the content on a number of platforms.
