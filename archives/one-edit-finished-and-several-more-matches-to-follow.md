It's the fourth day of the FIBA championship so it's the fourth day where I wake before 0400 european time. I wouldn't mind staying in bed a bit longer. I'm starting to understand the game better and I've seen that certain teams are far more entertaining to watch than others. On friday it's a day of rest. My dissertation research is currently stagnating as I'm so exhausted by the time I get home. The Lebanon edit is finished for the moment so I should be less tired, at last. On the sixth there's a projection of the full program so far. I've just thought back to my Tanzania edit and how I used to have a mentality whereby making longer documentaries was better than short ones. It's a mentality I lost when in England whilst doing my HND. I was brought up to concentrate on using screentime as efficiently as possible, forgetting that occasionaly it's important to let things breath. In December the same documentary will be around 50 minutes long.
