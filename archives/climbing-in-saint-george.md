Climbing inÂ Saint George is interesting for those living or working between Nyon and Morges. It provides routes from 4c to 7a and above and should cover most skill levels. Access time is a few seconds. You park your car near the lumber yard and a few seconds later you're at the climbing wall. The image below is to show how short the walk is. It is also there to facilitate your finding the place should you want to climb here. I mention this because Sunday someone said that she liked to go to various climbing walls but that she often found it a challenge to spot the correct location. The site that you see in this image varies from 4c to 6a+. The gradient is slightly positive so you are more likely to slip than slide. Most of the routes start easily but getting to the end is the challenge. Some of the finger holds are tiny and it's better to use new shoes. I'm using old worn out climbing shoes so my traction is not optimal so I climb using my heels when possible. To the right of the image above you have a small path that leads to a nice rock surface that is overhanging. Under this overhanging rock you find traces of barbecues, mattresses and a few quick draws. The climbing here is technical. It starts from 7a onwards so is more interesting for those climbers with the finger strength and endurance to attempt sustained overhanging climbs. \[caption id="attachment\_3311" align="aligncenter" width="576"\][![Saint George Overhang climbing](http://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/DSC_0012-576x1024.jpg)](http://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/DSC_0012.jpg) Saint George Overhang climbing\[/caption\] This is a nice location and if you walk further along, to behind the location from which I took this picture there is a cavern. This site looks interesting and yesterday there was an interesting sound. In a nearby valley or clearing Swiss military were practicing with .50 calibre guns. I called it artillery but a former British Marine classified the type of gun. If I was given the choice between DorÃ©naz and Saint George I would choose Saint George for climbing because if I'm going to climb a wall by a road it might as well be after a short drive.
