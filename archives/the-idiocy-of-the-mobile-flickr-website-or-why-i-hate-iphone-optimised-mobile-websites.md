Flickr had a mobile website that worked well because it was developed for all mobile devices. As a result I was getting into the habit of taking pictures, amending the title and adding comments whilst on the move. Recently though, the mobile developers at Flickr decided to do what every narrow minded developer of mobile websites likes to do. Develop something for the iphone and ipod touch. This is theoreticaly a great idea but in practice it's a nightmare for anyone using a normal phone. it's a nightmare because all of the mobile functionality of websites disappears. As a result of this the website is all but unusable. And no I'm not going to get an iphone. It's a shame that the mobile web developing community are doing this more and more. I hope that flickr will do their best to rectify this most annoying of situations.
