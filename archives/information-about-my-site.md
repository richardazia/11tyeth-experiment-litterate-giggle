Over the past twelve months over 28 gigs of data transfer have occured through 400,000 visitors and one and a half million hits. There have been 746 downloads of the Paddington station video as I write this. On youtube the same video has only had 30 views. This makes me happy because I see that you can make videos high profile from personal webpages and links added in the right place.
