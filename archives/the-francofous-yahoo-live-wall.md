The Francofous are a good group of people and last night we spent a few hours playing with [Yahoo Live](http://live.yahoo.com/) and skype. Skype provided the audio whilst yahoo live provided the video platform. Yahoo live is limited in the way we can watch and follow video so I created a simple [video wall](http://www.main-vision.com/francofous/francofous.html). The principle is simple. i get all the videos embedded into one page and we can watch everyone chat with everyone else. It's a really nice experience and I'm going to improve the layout for future games.
