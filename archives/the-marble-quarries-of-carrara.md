There is a rock quarry where we can climb not too far away. The rock is different so easier to climb. I don't think climbing on marble would be a good climbing experience. What is interesting about this image is the scale of the quarry. This is [Luna Marble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrara_marble).

> The huge marble quarries of Carrara, Italy were first opened by the Romans in the 2nd century BC, their highly prized stone used to create many of Rome's grandest monuments. They have since produced more marble than any other site on earth. Spot the diggers to see the epic scale! [pic.twitter.com/zM8hpytEd0](https://t.co/zM8hpytEd0)
