Here are some images from the lac de Joux a few weeks ago. I had not had enough of the frozen landscapes so I travelled further afield. I walked on the ice but there are moments when I could feel it creak as I walked. I didn't fall through the ice. \[flickr-gallery mode="photoset" photoset="72157629184590941"\]
