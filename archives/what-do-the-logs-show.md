I am getting somewhere with my studies. I feel that I am now starting to understand ideas and contexts and that as a result I can start working towards reaching and getting stuck on the next plateau, and the next one after that. In short, I am making progress.

Today the Steripen adventure opti arrived and I tested it in a container. Testing such a device on clean water is useless. I did learn that it is not dead on arrival.

I heard about ClassicPress while listening to a podcast so I downloaded the files, copied them to the htdocs folder, entered a few bits of information and it was up and running on my local machine. ClassicPress is a fork of WordPress.org. It aims to provide those who do not like Gutenburg with an alternative solution where they keep control of how posts are formated and displayed.

For now you can download wordpress plugins and use them on ClassicPress but I don't know for how long this interoperability will last. There is an explanation about [how to use shims to use incompatible apps.](https://docs.classicpress.net/developer-guides/providing-shims-for-functions-introduced-in-or-after-wordpress-5-0/)
