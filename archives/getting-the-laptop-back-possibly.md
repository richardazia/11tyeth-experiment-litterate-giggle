Tomorrow I should have a clearer idea on why the laptop decided to die on me but a phonecall yesterday points towards dust. I'm not sure what the dust may have destroyed but that's what may have caused the fault.Â  Without the laptop it's been an interesting week. It's seen me playing witgh two versions of linux and portable devices such as the N95 and the touch. Both have their merits and it's got me thinking about phasing out laptops from my use of the world wide web. What if i could get all podcasts, all e-mails and media content to both these devices without a computer? With Nokia podcasts I can get all the audio files, with interbine I can get all the videos. With S60 I get some browsing for flash content and with the ipod I get a nicer display for browsing content. Both are easy to carry. Â Both charge quickly with the right charger.Â  At the same time neither of them has a good typing keyboard, being perfect for short form but a nightmare for writing a blog post for example. With time the experience should improve.Â  Â  Â
