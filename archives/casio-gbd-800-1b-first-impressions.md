For 92 CHF you can buy the [Casio GBD-800-1B](https://www.casio.com/intl/watches/gshock/product.GBD-800-1B/) from conrad via [Galaxus](https://www.galaxus.ch/de/s8/product/g-shock-gbd-800-hybrid-uhr-sportuhr-digitaluhr-4860-mm-armbanduhr-9397360?gclid=CjwKCAiA2fmdBhBpEiwA4CcHzS_TacuTEkihXRirwO-5eLDk8mrLJAOiP8jXeVem-DACH3E-c_An5hoCUSIQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) and it will track you steps 24hrs a day and map your walks without you pressing a single button. This means that you can track your life, without thinking about it.

The problem with watches from the last five or so years is that they track steps, heart rate and more 24hrs a day, but need to be charged, and want to know what you're doing. They invade your life. "Are you walking now", "you should get up and walk for one minute", "you should go to sleep."

Feature Watch
-------------

Today I thought of a new term. Feature watches. We have smart watches and more. They try to get us addicted to their apps, and to tracking everything we do. Feature watches are the opposite. You put them on, and in theory you can wear them for three years before you remove them.

When I go for a run I will take the Garmin or the Apple watch, because they track heart rate and provide an idea of the fitness progression over time but the rest of the time I'd be happy with the Casio.

The advantage of a feature watch was demonstrated today. I put the watch on this morning and when I decided to go for a walk the phone's GPS tracked my movements automatically. The watch tracked the number of steps I took. When the walk the watch synced the step data with the phone app. I had a map of the walk I did, automatically.

Initially I had been tempted by a higher spec casio, specifically the [Casio Pro Trek PRT-B50](https://www.casio.com/intl/watches/protrek/products/collection/prt-b50/). It has many of the same features minus thermometer, barometer, altimeter and compass but [for 110 francs more](https://www.galaxus.ch/de/s8/product/casio-pro-trek-digitaluhr-5750-mm-armbanduhr-11313240) and it is large. It is nice to have watches that fit under sleeves.

And Finally
-----------

Although this watch promotes itself as a step tracker it offers more than that, by allowing you to automatically track walks, hikes, runs and more, without having to press any buttons or pay attention to the walk. It starts when you start, and it ends when you end. I need to experiment with cycling and driving, to see how it reacts in those situations. I am still forming my opinion but so far it feels good.
