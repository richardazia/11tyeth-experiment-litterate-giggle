Vlogging on a Via Ferrata with the Theta S by Ricoh is not only feasible but interesting. Earlier today I went to the Via Ferrata du Fort L'Ã©cluse in the French Region of Ain. This Via Ferrata goes long the nice rock face next to the climb. The purpose of this video is to bring you with me so that you can experience the sounds of Via Ferrata without the climbing experience or a head for heights. The Theta S by Ricoh is a 360Â° camera with two lenses. One lens is looking at the person taking video and the other lens looks at what the holder of the camera sees. When the two signals are combined you can export the video as a 360 video to be shared. The device has a mini HDMI out, a USB port, enough memory for 45 minutes of video at 1920X1080 with a 30FPS shooting range. It is currently one of the more affordable and intuitive devices to use. You can keep it with you at all times and getting material ready for editing takes seconds. The beauty of such a simple and light solution is that it allows for a very quick turnaround time. \[caption id="attachment\_2873" align="aligncenter" width="169"\][![You can review the footage instantly](http://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screenshot_20160515-143716-169x300.png)](http://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screenshot_20160515-143716.png) Reviewing footage is simple and intuitive\[/caption\] I was hanging off a cliff when I was taking my videos today but if you're a normal person you will probably be sitting in a cafÃ© or some stairs to review the footage. When device wifi is activated and when you download the app you can use your phone as a remote to take videos or pictures and even to watch back the video you have taken in 360Â° vision. If you're not happy with the shot then you can repeat it until you are happy. This system is a simple, elegant and all in one solution that is quick and intuitive to use.
