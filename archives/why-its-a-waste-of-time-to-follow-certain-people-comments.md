You raise some very valid points here Richard and on the whole I agree with you.  
  
I've recently gone through a Twitter cleansing process, dropping off a whole gang of folk, who although are well know in the Twitter stakes, were not adding any real value to my stream.  
  
I am now hitting a much higher percentage of folk whom I've conversed with and therefore, most likely, shared some common ground.  
  
These though, are not always people I'd go into a project with, although they may be people I'd share similar or project ideas with. In turn the value Twitter is offering me is increasing with each of these cleansing processes.  
  
That said, Twitter is a free tool that people are invited to with as they wish. Should people want to follow a hundred celebrity twitters to find out when they are getting out of the shower or stuck in a lift, then they are free to do so. This doesn't necessarily make them idiots.  
  
I also agree blogs are were the real thought goes in, its a slower more cerebral process blogging. Those that thought Twitter was the end of blogging were just jumping on a popularist bandwagon, there is plenty of space for both of them in the market.  
  
Twitter can be used for many things and that's one of the benefits of the interface that should be celebrated. You choose what enters your feed, you also choose what to do with that information.  
  
It's good to see people whom might otherwise never have spoken sharing and pooling similar ideas on a global instantaneous platform.  
  
Thanks for the post!

Writing about twitter is a good way by which to explore the site in more depth, as well as how people use it. Of course people are free to use it as they please. After all that's what I've been doing for months now.  
  
The point is simply that I like to think of it as a conversational, dynamic tool so I will use it as such, and I want people to see the reasons why simply following a lot of people may not be the best use twitter has to offer. I'm still part of the community after all all.  
  
What I like about blogs and personalities is that you don't expect them to interact as much. You know that they know about a topic and they will share their knowledge. As a result of this whether they answer to the comments doesn't matter, That's the nature of the medium.  
  
It goes back to McLuhan and his hot and cold media, which ones do we get a lot of information from and which ones are more passive, more conversational. If people do nothing but post to twitter, without people aknowledging anything then why drop into the site.  
  
Being passive on twitter means that eventually people would stop using the site though.

Hi Richard.  
  
Good thoughts here. Everyone has their own unique way of using Twitter, which I have heard called "shaping your Twitter stream." I agree, following 1000s of people is pretty much useless on Twitter, but being followed by 1000s without having to resort to "gaming" may just be a result of being interesting and informative.  
  
That is the purpose of my article. To let people know of another way they can get value from Twitter. I am not proposing people follow only the Internet Celebs. I don't follow all of them. I don't even think I follow many of the top ten on Twitter (based on followers) because of the reasons you mention above (no engagement, not interesting on Twitter).  
  
The article outlines my personal list of people that I follow who I get a ton of value from - the equivalent of a higher education regardless of whether I engage them or converse with them or not.  
  
Anyway thanks for engaging me here on your blog about my post. Always interested in other people's opinions, especially when they are the opposite of mine.

I don't disagree with following those people. after all I followed myself for weeks or even months before finding I had little or nothing more to gain. After all to some extent timezones, as much as anything else affect how interesting it is to follow certain people.  
  
Recently using twhirl I noticed that I was getting close to ten thousand tweets a day. That's a lot of information to sort through. The problem was that out of those thousands of tweets hardly ever resulted in personal engagement with certain individuals devaluing the practice to some extent.  
  
I do enjoy exploring people's blog posts at the same time. I enjoy that I now spend more time reading blog posts and commenting, seeing a broader range of opinions in the process.

I'm glad that you're still following me, so thanks for that.  
  
I might beg to differ with how you say what you do, but then again, it's your blog. My point is that everyone uses the tools differently. Some folks follow those other people because of all the information they provide. Not everyone wants Twitter to be a deeply personal, one-to-one experience.  
  
That YOU want it to be says a lot about you, and I'm glad you're using the tool that way. But telling other people that they're an idiot use it differently than you?  
  
I look forward to talking with you more some time.

I know that not everyone wants twitter to be personal, and that's part of what frustrates me at the moment. I feel that social networks are at their strongest when people have a personal connection with those they are followed by and who they follow.  
  
I'm listening to everyone, learning about their point of view. Earlier today one person who was not following that many, and not followed by that many said that he found tweetdeck to be interesting because he could join into a greater diversity of conversations. In that context I see the value of tweetdeck. I'm also happy for his comments that made me re-think that position.  
  
There are a number of services that aggregate content without people actively going through that data and it's a shame. Jaiku didn't grow as much as it could because of that problem. That's just one example of many of course.  
  
Those who are new to the social media should not forget that it's about conversation, that they shouldn't simply promote their product but instead take advantage to converse with their followers.  
  
Marketing and public relations have always wanted to know what people were thinking. Now that they can maybe they should spend more time listening, asking questions and digesting those responses.  
  
It's a complex issue and I love studying how the social media are evolving. I'd love to go into more detail but this is already a long comment.

I love twitter and I've given a lot of time to the site as a user. I've met some interesting people and had some interesting conversations. If I can keep it like that then I'm happy.  
  
Those who want to use twitter differently are free to do so. I simply won't follow their twitter activity because I don't enjoy it as much.

I have been testing the theory and so far I've been getting far better results. I send no more messages to those that don't answer because I don't follow them. I see more of the tweets by people who enjoy conversing and as a result I can have great conversations on twitter.  
  
The drawback is that I probably ended up flooding a few timelines recently. Not too worried though. It doesn't hapen all the time.  
  
300 people is a big investment of time when you're reading every tweet. At one point I was following over a thousand. I noticed on a few days that it meant receiving over 10,000 tweets a day. Now I only get two to three thousand I think. Much easier to manage :-)
