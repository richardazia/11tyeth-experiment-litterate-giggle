Today i went to buy myself a eee pc during my lunch break and by the time I was heading for homeÂ  the machine was recharged and ready to be played with. So far my biggest challenge is the tiny keyboard. Hard to touch type on it. Keep having to be careful to press each key properly. Other than that it took only a few minues per change I wanted to apply and the forums have quite a bi of information. It's a nice little machine and it's relatively cheap. It's also open source. Means tha it should be interesting to see how much I can get done on such a platform. That's it, enough typing on this keyboard for now.
