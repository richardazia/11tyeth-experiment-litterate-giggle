At the moment I'm re-reading the dissertation and going through every paragraph individually to make sure that the content is good. It's currently floating at about 9900 words and I'm feeling fairly confident with the content. there is still work to be done but within the next three or four days I hope to be done with this piece of work. Once more I went walking around the library and I met almost only girls from my course quite amusingly. They're at various levels of stress as you'd guess. Some are quite confident, feeling that they're well on their way whilst others prefer not to talk about the subject. through the status messages that one guy put on Facebook I thought that he had progressed really well but a message today led me to the opposite conclusion. It would be inferred from what he has written that he has not done as much work as I had thought initially. In other news, I tried working on the work experience module but I found that I simply ended up angry so I gave it up as a bad job. It's curious how that happened. I'll work on it in a day or two when I'm feeling more open to it.
