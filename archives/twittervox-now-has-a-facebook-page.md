[Twittervox,](http://operator11.com/shows/3235) a show which I do under the name [Warzabidul](http://twitter.com/warzabidul) with the help of [Loudmouthman](http://twitter.com/loudmouthman) of [Loudmouthman.com](http://loudmouthman.com/) now has a [facebook page](http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=7273246961) which I created earlier in the day. The point of this facebook is to bring together all those that have participated in the show so that they may discuss past and future program topics, from social media, through twitter rules and regulations and towards related topics like [seesmic](http://www.seesmic.com/) and [Second life](http://secondlife.com/). If you're on twitter or seesmic and have a facebook account then come and join the conversation. We're waiting for you.
