Whilst listening to Macbreak weekly I heard about Editgrid, a web based spreadsheet that resembles many others with a difference. It's optimised for the Iphone if you go to iphone.editgrid.com. It's an interesting implementation which can as easily be edited online as offline. This is great for those that may need quick access to a spreadsheet without the weight of a laptop at the same time. It's a simple to use application which doesn't take a long time to sign up to and gives you flexibility. There is one major disadvantage. It's hard to select a cell to add data and inputing date by hunt and peck is very slow. I'd therefore recommend using it as a tool for referencing rather than data entry. See if your views differ from mine.
