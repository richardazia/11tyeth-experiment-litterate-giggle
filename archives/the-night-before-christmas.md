It's the night before Christmas day and it's been relaxed. With the thermal inversion it's easy to get above the clouds, simply get in a car and go to the mountains and you'll get a nice view of the sunshine. We went to the vall√©e de Joux and that's where you find many of the watch factories. This includes Audemars Piguet amongst others. Tomorrow's Christmas day, then 6 days till the new year.
