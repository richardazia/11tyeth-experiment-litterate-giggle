Now that I've achieved my goal of getting most of my dissertation written I'm going to take a day's break and work on another of my assignments to clear my head and also to make sure I complete all assignments by the required date. It's been a long effort but last night I spent several hours working on my dissertation, getting it up to 8800 words. The word limit is from 10-12000 words and having almost 8.8K means I'm 1200 words away. With re-writing and clarification of certain points I should easily get up to the word limit that was set out initially. I'm happy about the state of affairs. Over two weeks for editing and cleaning up of the text. There's another assignment that I will work on the 22nd of this month and another which I will start working on later today. With the way things are going, I should quite easily be able to meet all the deadlines and have time to be human by the same opportunity. It's a great feeling. Finally, the glacier that was pressing down on me is starting to melt and I'll begin to rise up as the pressure is released, much as England is doing since the last glacial age hundreds of thousands of years ago.
