When I first saw seesmic I thought of it as a video version of twitter but that point of view has shifted. I now think of it as an online video forum where video messages have replaced both text and pictures. I would expect many more websites of the sort to grow and it will see in a new era in social interactions on the web. What I question is how long this video chatting website will last. Is there much demand for such a product and will it see itself become a valuable web success or simply another stepping stone in the road towards an increasingly digital lifestyle. What are your thoughts on the topic?
