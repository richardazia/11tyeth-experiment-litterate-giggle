The American blogosphere is corrupt. Google Plus is an excellent product. It provides it's users with an elegant amount of control as to who sees which post and whom it can be shared with. It provides groups and communities. It allows you to create your own circles. In Essence Google Plus is an extraordinarily flexible space where community building should be encouraged.
