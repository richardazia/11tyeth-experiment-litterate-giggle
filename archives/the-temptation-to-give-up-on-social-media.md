I find myself tempted to give up on social media and focus on blogging instead. I am tired of social media after decades of use. I am tired that users, that provide all of the value are ignored, and that greedy boards of directors can sell users as if they were lumps of coal or sugar beets.

By being sold to Musk Twitter has become a symbol of the Far Right, and Far Right ideologies are being pushed. Musk pushed a poll asking whether Drumpf should be reinstated and for now Drumpf is winning. This means that in a few days Musk will be able to say "I brought back Drumpf because that is what people wanted." He already said that he would skew the algorithms to favour what he thinks of as positive.

That's why I don't want to use Twitter anymore. That's why the last social network that I have been using discourages me from staying around. It's not that I don't like the community. It's that I don't like what the person in charge represents.

Yet again, we, the early adopters, who provided a social network with value, and the inertia to become one of the leading social networks, are homeless, and in need of a new place to use socially.

I am not convinced by Mastodon because people are too eager to onboard, get people to add alt text to images, and use hashtags. It doesn't feel like a community. It feels like a sect trying to find converts. I want to have conversations, not be nagged about alt tags, and the use of hashtags.

When twitter was young, around 2007 or 2008 the introduction of hashtags, to a large degree destroyed the conversation, and turned social media into a popularity contest, rather than a network of friends, conversing with other friends. I am on social media to be sociable. Social media is a shell of its former self. I'd rather revert to blogging and generate content that will benefit me, rather than billionaires who do not see any value in users.

Before I end this post, it feels as if social media has become like normal life. The loud popular extroverts have huge followings and we are competing against them, as introverts. Fighting for attention takes away a lot of the pleasure of social media. I might as well meet people in the physical world, for that type of competition.

I might as well blog. If I am heard, then that's good, and if I am not then I have practiced writing.
