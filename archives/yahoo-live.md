[Yahoo live](http://live.yahoo.com/) is an interesting live video conferencing tool still in it's early days. It allows you to stream video live from your webcam and watch up to four other streams at the same time. There's a chatroom and you can see all the participants at once and select which ones you want in vision and which you'd prefer out of vision. There are a few bugs at the moment. I haven't found sound that easy to deal with, especially since there's a five to ten second delay. Chatting with Msiou he told me that what he had done is use skype conference calls to keep the conversation going. Of course this is a makeshift solution and some better interaction should come.
