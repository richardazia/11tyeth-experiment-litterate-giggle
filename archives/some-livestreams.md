It's a shame I was running low on battery last night because I was at the Fanzone in Geneva for the Italy Vs. France match. I managed to stream a few moments of the game. Since the Italians have won this game we can look forward to a lot of noise on Sunday if and when they win.Â  Perfect for me and live streaming. Â  The Penalty.  Post match euphoria for the Italians, by then the French were already heading home.
