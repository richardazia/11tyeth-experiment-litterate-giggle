Every sunday I try not to use the car at all. As a result I went for a walk through the local countryside and experimented with the new camera. I was looking at the streams but they were quite low, not such a great opportunity to test the underwater part. \[flickr-gallery mode="photoset" photoset="72157624577824618"\]
