I feel absolutely no need for a free SMS application when I have something as powerful as twitter. If more people would use it then I would have a lot more IRL friends following my moves. As things are the idea of sending short messages to just one or two individuals at a time seems and feels so old fashioned to me that when it does occur it's from another time. If I'm at the computer I'm not going to waste time sending an SMS: I'm going to write you a message on any of a number of social networking websites and I will understand that a global audience may see that. That's what I want. I really like twitter and i wish more people would use it. There's no guarantee I'd follow some of my friends of course, but having two or three more friends use it wouldn't go amiss.
