A lot of things in the air yesterday night, we were pretty close and not so anonym, just us, alone in the night, just voice to voice. Funny. Thank you Richard to report this.

As someone may think : this is not so unusual to meet people like this accross the world. The spirit was different there. The subjects weren't only techies stuff. but writing with Purplecar or business and entrepreneurship with Eric Rice. And everybody was discussing over. when some french didn't really get. well they asked in the chat room and so on. Thank you for this article. I'm wondering if the seesmic servers will go down again ( but I really don't think so ). The seesmic brought us there and made us so very close, so friendly with each others it was just great. I understood also even more why it's a great tool : everybody can talk whithout being stopped by someone else. A thing that no other tool can bring us. Thanks for this post !
