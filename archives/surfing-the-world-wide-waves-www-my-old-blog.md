The World Wide Web is a large and impressive playground where I enjoy spending time. Over time there are various elements that I find are interesting. This section started as part of the school newspaper whilst still at high school and was also on the newspaper's website which I was in charge of maintaining.

This is my old blog. I am in the process of transferring the old pages to the current blog.
