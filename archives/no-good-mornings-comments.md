It's a bizarre sensation - you get so used to it and then the morning Twitter is down you find yourself both supremely productive and wondering quite what to do. I'm trying to work out whether my reluctance to migrate to either Jaiku or Pownce is simply because Twitter is where my friends are, or because the interface is unfamiliar and slightly uncomfortable - like standing in a room you don't really know. Will we migrate? I don't know - it depends who parts the waters and makes that first, dynamic move :)
