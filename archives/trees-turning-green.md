Trees are currently turning green on the Jura. Leaves are growing and so the colour of the Jura is shifting from brown to green at last. Trees suffer in Summer at the moment, due to the lack of rain. T[hat lack of rain results in them changing colour sooner](https://www.rts.ch/info/sciences-tech/environnement/13909189-en-europe-les-forets-brunissent-de-plus-en-plus-en-vite.html).

Yesterday I went for a run in between two lots of rain and I was lucky. As I arrived home rain started to fall on me. Within minutes I could hear lightning and the rain started to fall heavily. I was lucky. I timed my run to be right in between two lots of rain. It would have soaked me if I had been unlucky.

Ultrasound Plants
-----------------

According to a Tel Aviv university plants broadcast their distress, either from [drought or from injury.](https://www.rts.ch/info/sciences-tech/13907866-quand-elles-sont-stressees-les-plantes-emettent-des-ultrasons.html) Imagine the noise during a forest fire or when plants are harvested.

The Hidden Life of Trees
------------------------

When walking in a shopping centre I noticed a few books about trees. I saw The Hidden life of Trees and started to read it, as an e-book, despite seeing the physical book. I could have bought it in French but English was cheaper. It speaks about how trees communicate with each other, although I haven't read far enough to understand how. It also speaks about how crops are silent and isolated, due to how they are planted. I will elaborate when I know more.

It's interesting to consider that plants can communicate with sound, or through networks of fungus under the ground. It's interesting to consider the wood wide network, the notion that the soil is a means of communicating between trees. I am currently trying to revive a few orchids. After a year or two of thriving they suddenly slowed down and now seem to be struggling for life. I want to revive them.
