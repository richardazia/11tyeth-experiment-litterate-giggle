They announced that it would be windy today and it is. Windy days are fun because the lake goes from blue or green to English Breakfast tea brown. The waves crash against the walls and spray the promenade that goes from the Pont Du Mont Blanc to the Jardin Anglais. For now it's getting things wet. With the right wind and low temperatures it could be great for the taking of photos.

When I was taking pictures and videos my fingers got cold enough for me to try to warm up again on the exercise machines by the Bain de Paquis. It was cold enough to get cold while taking pictures and video.

Despite this cold some eccentric people still went for a swim. This, despite the waves, the wind, and the windchill. I saw two people swim, and then a third person swim. I then saw a group arrive for their Sunday swim.

As I walked to where the people go to set off I thought they would miss their swim in light of the conditions. I'm surprised that some people went for a solitary swim in such conditions. I'd prefer to have someone just in case I need help.
