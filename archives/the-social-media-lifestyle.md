I believe I'm living the social media lifestyle, that is that wherever I go I have both my mobile phone and my ipod touch. As a result I am never more than a hotspot away from the world wide web and it's content. In Switzerland I'm online as I hike through the mountains taking pictures which I can then upload to flickr for you to enjoy. That's also the reason I decided to start a new blog called [The Social Media Lifestyle](http://socialmedialifestyle.com/). The purpose of the new blog will be to explore the thoughts and conversations I have with non social media nuts and why they are not interested in being as active as we are. I have based my first serious post around a conversation in the TGV from Paris to Geneva and some overheard comments at a cinema in Switzerland. What I hope to achieve through this blog is to shift the conversation away from how advertisers can promote brands and products and instead promote the adoption of new social tools such as Facebook, twitter, seesmic, flickr and plurk to name but a few. We've got to find the best way to explain to our audience why and how the social media will improve, rather than degrade their lifestyle.
