Today I came across the concept of Soft Hiking. Unlike Hot girl Hiking soft hiking is about just going out for a walk. It’s about getting moving, no matter your level of ability, or fitness. it’s about getting into the habit of not sitting around. 

They write about looking at nature, stopping for a snack or to sit on a bench, to enjoy being outdoors rather than indoors.

I am part of the problem. I am one of the reasons for which people want “soft hiking”. I am part of the problem because I walk fast, because I like to move fast and efficiently over challenging terrain. I find that up to 3000m I am a fast walker, compared to many, but that after 3000m of altitude I slow down and become normal. 

If you read about running, or if you watch videos about the topic then you will come across the idea of running efficiency. The idea is that as you run your body, and muscles, adapt to the exercise and so you become faster, stronger, and more efficient. 

I believe that the same is true of hiking. It makes sense that someone that walks four million to five and a half million steps a year would move around more efficiently when hiking. We have put in the time and effort, which is why we knacker those with less experience. It’s about physical form. 

[Soft hiking says to go slow, take in your surroundings](https://www.bustle.com/wellness/soft-hiking-tiktok), and to stop for drinks and snacks. That’s what everyone, at every fitness level does. 

A number of books I have read, by thru-hikers, speak about feeling that they are slow compared to others. There is a visible culture of people feeling that they walk slowly compared to others. [Alone in Wonderland](https://www.aloneinwonderland.com/) explores this topic. 

She explored the idea of gliders and plodders. I’d be seen as a glider because of how fast I walk, compared to most, but as I have joked about before, part of the reason that I walk fast is that I walk alone, so I never walk at a normal conversational pace. I could slow down and plod, but when I plod my strides shorten, and I feel muscles slowing down my legs, to keep at a comfortable pace for someone else. 

Quite a few thru-hiking books and podcast episodes speak about “hike your own hike” and people separating during the day, to walk at their own pace, before meeting up at night, for sleep and dinner. 

Through the popularisation of Soft Hiking more people will hike. As more people hike, so we have more people to hike with. Hiking is a good, environmentally friendly sport, because it requires no roads, little to no infrastructure. 

Soft hiking could have a reduced carbon footprint. It doesn’t require a long drive to the mountains. It just requires people to step out of their homes and walk. That’s good.
