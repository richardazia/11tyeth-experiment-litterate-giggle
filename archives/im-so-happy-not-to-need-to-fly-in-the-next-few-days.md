There's some great news and some bad news. The great news is that the English government says it managed to prevent a series of terrorist attacks within the last twenty four hours. What's not so great is that many people end up stranded at various airports around the world. Apparently over 200 flights and 200,000 people are affected in the UK alone with repercussions around the world. For those who are already on the spot this was good news since it means they're forced to extend their holidays by a day or two. For those who were stranded at the airport it's the nightmare scenario we'd all hate to experience. We've all known delays but in this circumstance we're talking about hours of delay. I hope that the idea of preventing people taking laptops and other devices on planes is not realised as I'd hate to be forced to put my electronics in the luggage hold as I know how battered it would be.
