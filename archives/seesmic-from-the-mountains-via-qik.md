Whilst the connection is unstable and slow I decided to take the phone and Qik some landscapes from La Dole in Switzerland. Here are a few streams. As more people enjoy streaming live video from interesting locations so this will become a more common site.     What I hope to do next is go to some of the higher peaks and stream from there too. Overtime we could have a nice collection of footage.
