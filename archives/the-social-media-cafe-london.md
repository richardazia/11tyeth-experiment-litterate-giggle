Friday morning a few people from the Social Media scene met at the Breafast Club for the [Social Media Cafe.](http://londonsocialmediacafe.pbwiki.com/Second%20Prototyping%20Meeting%20080111) A few of the usual people were there to discuss the direction the Social Media Cafe should take. There was talk about the need for more frequent of these events to take place as a way for people to get up to speed with what other people have been up to as well as to enable easier collaboration.
