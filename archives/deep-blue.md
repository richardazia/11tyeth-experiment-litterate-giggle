It's fun to watch documentaries when you know that they spent at least two to three years in the making. I like the documentary because it's an opera rather than a documentary. There is a minimum of comment and a maximum of shots. There are some sequences where you see things happening in front of the camera and it switches to a second camera. That's because for sequences like the penguins jumping out of the water they filmed it with one film camera and one pole. Doesn't that make you wish you were studying a media BA. where part of your studies is television. Every field of studies has it's advantages. One person I know is studying [James Bond](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/search?ie=UTF8&keywords=James%20bond&tag=perspectraveland&index=dvd-uk&linkCode=ur2&camp=1634&creative=6738)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=perspectraveland&l=ur2&o=2) films, another is doing [Disney cartoons](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/search?ie=UTF8&keywords=disney%20cartoons&tag=perspectraveland&index=dvd-uk&linkCode=ur2&camp=1634&creative=6738)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=perspectraveland&l=ur2&o=2). I'm doing [underwater documentaries](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/search?ie=UTF8&keywords=underwater%20documentaries&tag=perspectraveland&index=dvd-uk&linkCode=ur2&camp=1634&creative=6738)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=perspectraveland&l=ur2&o=2) between France and England. Another is doing something related to social elements and zombies. One is doing special effects It's a broad range and that should make it more interesting to those that have to read through all this content.
