Tonight I did my first proper live program on [Operator 11](http://www.operator11.com) and it went really well. The participants for this show were Loudmouthman of [Loudmouthman.com](http://www.loudmouthman.com), Phil Campbell of [me.dm](http://me.dm) and Rotjong of [Lowlands 2007 mashup](http://www.todaysart.nl/LL07/).  We discussed the twitter meetup but quickly moved onto a variety of subjects. The conversation begins after a few seconds of twittervision.
