At one time a website called mp3.com existed to facilitate the sharing of music. I enjoyed this website and downloaded quite a lot of music from there. At the time the idea was to share music for free. It was in the days before myspace grew in popularity. The site is [http://amiestreet.com/](http://amiestreet.com/ "amie street") There is one slight difference: _All songs on Amie Street start FREE and can rise to 98 cents. We're about discovery, not raiding your wallet_. That's perfect. If it's good they make money, helping to fund the website and the artists and if it's not that popular yet then lot's of people getting it for free means more advertising. It's an interesting idea
