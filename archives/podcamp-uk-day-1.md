Today has been an informative day where there have been many conferences to participate in. The morning saw the introduction of the event whilst later on a great discussion took place about social networking and I've got the footage to give you an idea of the direction the conference was taking. On a side note we were introduced to [vlogsnapz](http://vlogsnapz.com/), an application designed to make video blogging simpler. So far I've seen that you can upload to a number of popular video sharing website and the interface is simple. When you record the application gives you accept, refuse and set tasks to offer a few extra options. Here's a quick link to a [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSKw1gTP1k8) shot last night and edited by 7am today.
