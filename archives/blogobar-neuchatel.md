One of the most amusing things about the blogobar meetup in Neuchatel was how many iphones were there. It was particularly amusing to see the time spent look at apps, trying to see which was the most fun. Of course we didn't travel from various parts of Switzerland for that sole purpose. It would have been silly and we would have renamed the event, Iphone party Switzerland or the likes.  Those present were Xavier Bertschy of [multimediacertified.ch](http://multimedia-certified.ch/fr/), John Maim of [Minsh](http://minsh.net/), Alexander Matti of [blackberry-fr,](http://www.blackberry-fr.com/) Stephan Blanchard of [apus3](http://www.apus3.com/) and Samuel Kohler of [Marketing Alternatif](http://marketing-alternatif.ch/). The venue was the [Sultan](http://www.sultanindian.ch/) in Neuchatel. The next [Blogobar](http://www.blogobar.ch/) will take place in March in Vevey so if you're interested in coming to the event then just sign up.
