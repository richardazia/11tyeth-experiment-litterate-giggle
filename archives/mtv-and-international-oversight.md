When the VMA are advertised everywhere and where there is easy access to information about everything that is going on around the world MTV appears short sighted. If you've got an award ceremony that you're telling the world about then you'd better give the world access to all the footage for the simple reason that you're missing a good advertising opportunity. By restricting access to the footage two things are happening. You're frustrating the users that have heard bad things about the performance and how bad it was and you're missing the hype wagon that would follow behind such an event taking place. Those in charge of such channels should take the time to take advantage of the global reach especially with a medium such as a world wide web page.
