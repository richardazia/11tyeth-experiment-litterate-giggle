I’m finding that I’m doing the same these days. Twitter has become a torrent of noise and nobody seems to be really conversing these days. I had a lot of value out of early Twitter, and made some good friends as well as getting support for things like programming and events etc. Lately as you say it’s become useless. Facebook for me was always a way of keeping in touch with close friends and family, as well as getting support and organising events. But in the last few years it’s got worse and gone from a time sink to a toxic mess. I like blogs, they’re honest, you can make longer articles and people are guaranteed to see them if they want, and they’re longer lasting. Blogs will be around long after Facebook has gone away.

The strength of twitter was when it was used as a synchronous conversation medium. Once people fed RSS content to the medium it lost it's primary purpose. That's where blogging regains its appeal. We can comment and wait for a few hours before answering. We've been blogging for two decades by now.
