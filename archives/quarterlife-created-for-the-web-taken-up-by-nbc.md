[Quarterlife](http://quarterlife.com/) is a show about what life is like for those at the quarter life mark, in their mid twenties. Last week their first episode came out and already they've [signed a deal with NBC](http://mashable.com/2007/11/16/nbc-quarterlife/) for it to be broadcast on NBC. That's an interesting development. Â When you read the article you understand why the show has been successfully pitched and purchased. Tomorrow is the next episode of the show.
