Every morning the landscape is covered in frost. That frost melts and turns to water, which in turn, turns to mud, and cakes my shoes. Unfortunately there has been no rain for weeks, and there is no rain expected for weeks. We are in another drought although most people will not call it that, yet. They prefer to enjoy the sunshine and ignore the deeper problem.

This risk of drought is recognised. The [RTS wrote about how people are getting water tanks](https://www.rts.ch/info/regions/vaud/13788190-contre-les-secheresses-recentes-les-suisses-sequipent-de-citernes-a-eau-de-pluie.html), due to the regularity of droughts. The problem is so bad that aside from the article about people buying water tanks to store their own rain water there is another one speaking about how the [underground water table is at risk](https://www.rts.ch/info/suisse/13789035-le-niveau-au-plus-bas-des-nappes-phreatiques-devient-preoccupant.html). "Il faudrait donc qu'il pleuve quasiment non-stop jusqu'à fin mars pour que les nappes phréatiques retrouvent leur niveau normal". It would need to rain non-stop for two weeks for the water tables to find their required levels.

I miss the rain. I miss the rain because when it rains it feels like a treat to have good weather. I miss the rain because I like the sound it makes on the roof. I miss the rain because it fills the rivers and makes them interesting to watch. I miss the rain because without rain the sky becomes boring. There is no reason to look at the sky, or to look at weather apps when the weather never changes.

One of the most flagrant changes, when there is enough rain, is how the grass and other plants grow, by the side of the road. Paths that were easy to walk along, before rain, would become more challenging to walk along, when the rain has given the plants the water they need to grow. It means less grass cutting, it means fewer plants growing. We're in spring now, and without rain we will not see plants germinate in the usual way.

I miss bad weather because the pandemic isn't over, and there is nothing to be gained from the weather being good. Good weather is monotonous.
