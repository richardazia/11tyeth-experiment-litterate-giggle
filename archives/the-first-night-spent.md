Last night was the first night of many that I will spend at my new flat. At the moment I've got two flats in London which is a luxury. I need to move in properly on Saturday morning after a heavy night of partying we'll see how it is. What I've noticed so far is a fast internet connection ranging from 600 Kbs to slower speeds for extended periods of times and that's even when I'm two floors above the hub. I'm within short walking distance of a number of shops like Sainsbury's, a 24hr McDonald's and more. It's also on the 29 bus route and is close to many things of which I have to investigate the matter further. We'll see how other nights will be.
