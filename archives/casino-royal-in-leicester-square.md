I went to Leicester Square tonight and I saw many celebrities for the opening of Casino Royal, the new bond film. Among those present were the scissor sisters, Girls aloud, Richard Branson, Mohammed Al Fayed, Paris Hilton, Sting, Elton John, Eva Green, The songwriter, Miss MoneyPenny, Dame who plays M and a few other celebs. It was good fun in central London. I have uploaded some pictures. One of the images is of a friend shaking hands with Daniel Grey [Casino World Premiere](http://www.main-vision.com/richard/casino/casino.html)
