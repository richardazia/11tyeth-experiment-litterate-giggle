Remember when I wrote 50,000 words in one month? Today's challenge is a little different. From tomorrow, and for the next 30 days I will have the task of writing 100 pages for a script within 30 days. That's about three pages a day and it shouldn't be too hard. I've done a lot of transcribing so I know dialogue when I hear it. I did also have to study it in uni. Now we'll see what the result is. I don't even have a topic yet.
