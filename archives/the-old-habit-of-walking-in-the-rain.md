A Walk In The Rain
------------------

Today it was meant to rain for the entire day but there was a brief window which it stopped raining so I went for a walk. I expected not to be rained on but within minutes I could feel a small spray of water falling on me. I walked anyway. It was nothing to worry about. I did the usual walk and although groups of people were walking they were easy to avoid. The rivers are nice and full today so rain is having an effect. Rain has melted the snow that had covered the landscape and filled the rivers. In some places there are traces that the water is slightly polluted.

Reading and Projets
-------------------

I am listening to The Age of Wood as I walk. I am struggling to get into it. I did read about the [Chemin De La Mature](https://www.etonnantes-pyrenees.com/hauts-lieux-du-gr10-le-chemin-de-la-mature/) and that does sound like an interesting place to visit. It is a path cut through the rock. They didn't cut through the rock from top to bottom though. They cut through it horizontaly. It looks like an interesting experience to walk along that path. In some images it looks narrow, but in others it looks comfortable to walk along. I need to find more information about the GR-10 walking route, to see whether it would be interesting to see the larger context.

Tracking, Without Charging
--------------------------

I tracked the walk the usual way, with a gps watch, but I also tracked it with the [Core-S4](https://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/initial-thoughts-on-the-crosscall-core-s4/) and so far the results are good. I have tracked two walks over two days, without charging between the two walks and the phone is still fine. I don't need to charge it every day. I like this. I like that I have a watch that I charge once a week or less, and a phone that I don't need to charge every evening. This means that I could travel away for a weekend carrying less weight. I could go without chargers for the first time in years.

We will see what I play with tomorrow.
