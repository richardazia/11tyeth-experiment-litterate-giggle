[![We climbed the ladder for two different reasons. ](http://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/picture-22-300x117.png "Two of Qik\'s top users")](http://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/picture-22.png)

Today both a friend and I are among the top qikkers of the day. Whilst [Documentally](http://www.twitter.com/documentally) of [Ourmaninside.com](http://www.ourmaninside.com) was in Milton Keynes getting an iphone 3g and [streaming a number of videos on the experience](http://qik.com/video/126685) I was [filming dancers](http://qik.com/video/128128) at the Geneva lake Parade. Both these events have appeal for different reasons. We're used to watching videos of Americans getting the iphone and doing a variety of geek events and for once we had the English experience. It's not a very visual occurrence but at least it's been streamed and shared. He also took the opportunity to speak about [lifecast](http://lifecast.sleepydog.net/), a new way of sharing the media you generate over a day. The Lake Parade is a very different type of event. It's the type of event photographers and camera oeprators go to in order to get video and photographs of girls dancing to music. It's only once a year and previous years have been better. I like the fact that I can go to the event with a phone, stream video straight to the web and all without the hassle of a camera and laptop. I'm commenting on the latter because it's the second time I see someone walking with a laptop in order to do some live streaming of an event whilst I'm very light. I could have shot in high definition but everyone's doing that. What interests me is going to an event, finding some action, sharing it live as it happens and not have any real post production concerns. In general live streaming from mobile phones is an interesting way of covering events that does not get much publicity. As a result the audiences are not as large as they could be but that will change. It's just a matter of getting people used to the idea of webcams and live streams being more interesting than a static twenty meters from where the action is happening.
