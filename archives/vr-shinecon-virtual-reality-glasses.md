TheÂ [VR Shinecon Virtual Reality glasses](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01DBQUSQK/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=mainvision-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B01DBQUSQK&linkId=3699a5079a05b0632ab7669e075fcfec)Â provide a low cost opportunity for people to experience Virtual Reality content and immersive videos with their existing phone rather than investing hundreds in a new phone and VR headset. it can fit phones from 4 to 6 inches easily. The front panel opens to accommodate a diversity of phones and sizes. You can open the front panel, place your phone and centre it, and then close it. Before you close the front panel make sure to launch the VR app or content that you want to experience. [Jaunt VR](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jauntvr.android.player.cardboard) is one app that is easy and intuitive to use. Once the front panel is closed and you put on the VR headset you can adjust focus Â to suit your eyesight. This control is on the right and left side of the goggles.The inter-ocular distance can be adjusteÂ to suitÂ the spacing between your eyes via the wheel at the top of the headset.Â The straps are velcro so adjusting the headset to your head size is also intuitive. The phone compartment has two openings on either side. This opening allows for headphones to be plugged in to the VR headset as well as a USB cable to charge the phone if you are using this device for an extended period of time. With the Samsung Gear headset the USB port is taken up by the external controls. This means that although you can use your phone with the headset on you lose the ability to recharge the phone.

Good for demos
--------------

If you are demonstrating VR content to clients then you have two options. The first option is to have more mobile phones than VR headsets. This allows for one or two backup phones to charge whilst the others are being used to view VR content. The other option is to recharge the phone while people are enjoying the VR experience or even to try the VR experience with their own phone. Imagine the effect that this would have on potential VR enthusiasts. When they see that there is almost no barrier to entry it will encourage them to join in the experience.

summary
-------

The positive aspects of this headset are that it can accept most phones, you can adjust focus and interocular distance intuitively and strap adjustments are easy. It works well with youtube and the JauntVR app. The negative aspects of this headset are that light leaks in so the immersive experience is diminished there is a slight learning curve as you learn to adjust the headset to your requirements. You can only control apps that allow you to look at something specific to start playing content. I would recommend this headset for people getting in to VR who want to enjoy immersive content withoutÂ spending too much money on features that they do not yet require.
