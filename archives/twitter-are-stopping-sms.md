If the companies can't behave then we'll rely on Air applications to aggregate and monitor what's going on. I already watch seesmic, twitter, identi.ca and friendfeed with twhirl. All this to say something simple. If you want me to keep coming to your site provide me with the best user experience possible. If not then I'll be as uncommitted as possible. So will everyone else
