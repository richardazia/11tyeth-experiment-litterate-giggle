Most of the rooms are empty and cars are parked everywhere. That's because today is the penultimate day of halls and everyone is leaving. Tomorrow at 10am all rooms should have been evacuated for the cleaning services to come and prepare the rooms for the summer groups. It feels like me like waiting for a plane, everything is packed and there's not much to do until tonight's party. The bedroom is cleaned and stuff is packed. It's pretty quiet, many people leaving, everything is finished now. I'm looking forward to living in a more diverse part of London which will serve as a base for my job seeking. It's going to be nice when, tomorrow, I have moved in to my new flat properly.
