Sometimes you go for a daily walk and all the roses are starting to emerge, and these are not tiny ones. These are saucer sized roses. They are mainly growing at the side of orchards. These are Red and pink, but there are other colours, so if I walk in the right places I should find them too.

I could have posted these images to Instagram or Facebook, but I'd rather post them on my own website, for the world to see, maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but eventually, three to six years from now. ;-)
