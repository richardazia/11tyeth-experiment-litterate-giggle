Imagine that you break a leg, but instead of speaking about rehabilitating that leg, and getting back to doing fun things, you get distracted by the joy/misfortune of breaking your leg again. I see people worrying about the next pandemic today, but this is silly. Why would you start thinking about the next pandemic when the current one isn't understood or declining? Instead of ignoring the current problem and focusing on the next, people should be addressing a number of key problems.

The first are disinformation and misinformation. How can you get people who are not enthusiastic about masks and vaccinations to be enthusiastic about vaccinations and masks. If you achieve this, then the pandemic takes a gigantic leap towards being finished.

The second challenge is to convince economists and businesses, that not making money for two or three months because of a lockdown to get to zero-covid is more interesting than living for two years in a pandemic. Zermatt, apparently, lost millions in reservations, due to insecurity around the Covid situation. In my opinion this should convince economists and businesses, that zero covid and soft lockdowns, in the short run, will bring big gains in the long run.

For now the dog is chasing after its tail, people are growing fatigued with half-thought out measures, and they want to see an end to the pandemic, but we are at wave five out of more. The vaccine for Beta was already not ideal for Delta, and now there is talk of another vaccine being needed for Omicron. At the current rate we will always be one variant behind, and in Europe and the US, governments are playing catch up, rather than neutralise. Covid-zero would shorten the pandemic by years, at this point. The status quo could last for years, and in that context, migration becomes interesting.

I am bored with the pandemic and I want it to be over, but I don't see how this is possible, for as long as governments keep repeating the same mistakes over and over.
