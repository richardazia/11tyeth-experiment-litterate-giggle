App.net is a result of the time at which it came out. It is like twitter was back in 2007, it has the community feel, the engagement and more. It's already international with people covering every time zone but not yet every continent. These users are all early adopters. They are either developers or early adopters. The developers play and create new tools for those who are interested in the social aspect. Would you pay 50 dollars for what I describe above? Probably not. This demonstrates the coming of age of a concept that has been around for five years. Five years ago no one would have paid for twitter. No one would have paid for many of the services we have now. Porn and dating services are apparently the only things that used to work as communities.
