This is the day 16+ and 5+ year olds could get boosters and Vaccinate in Switzerland. For 16+ year olds, at least in Vaud, we are now eligible for vaccination, as long as we're in the country. I am not. I have to wait until I get back. This is a big step forward. Being able to get a booster is good. 5+ year old children should be able to get their first vaccine shortly, although the details are not clear yet.

I wish I was in Switzerland to enjoy the weather. For once, it is snowing, so for once it would be interesting to look at the landscape. I was bored with seeing sunshine every day for years in a row. By the time I get back, the landscape will be boring again. If it wasn't for the growing number of new cases, I would be driving from CH to Spain on Sunday, not two weeks ago.

I am still reading every day. I am currently reading a book about the Camino De Santiago. The journey describes quite a few days of rain, and the thoughts of a single woman, on a long hike, for a change. Plenty of books have been written by men. Fewer have been written by women. It is nice to get that perspective for a change.

I usually read until I can't keep my eyes open, and sometimes I read during the night if I wake up. For two weeks I haven't listened to audiobooks as I haven't had moments of solitude. Usually I listen when I walk alone. I still ignore podcasts, I get my news from tweets and news websites. I also get news from sources where I am not forced to spend a specific amount of time. Text is easy to skim quickly.

That's it for today. I had no daily walk so there is no news on that front.
