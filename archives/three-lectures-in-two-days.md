Over the past two days I have been to three lectures of sorts. I went to listen to what people had to say about aid workers and journalism, what [A crude Awakening](http://www.frontlineclub.com/club_events.php?day=2007-09-24) was like and finally today to a talk about [whether television should be trusted](http://www.lse.ac.uk/collections/LSEPublicLecturesAndEvents/events/2007/20070809t0937z001.htm). All of these events were good and will get a proper write up within the next day or two.
