Today we might as well speak of blue skies and autumn leaves because that is what we're facing. The Septemper/Autumn grey clouds, fog, and cold are not here yet. Instead we have warm sunny days. The habit of walking one and a half hours a day is perfectly safe, with such a stable weather system.

Sigg Bottles
------------

I have two Sigg water bottles, the half litre and the one litre. For months or even a year they lied dormant due to the pandemic and attempts to clean them. I used the tablets but I didn't like the taste so I left them aside. Yesterday or the day before I decided to take a sponge and clean the exterior and mouth of the bottles. That's when the taste I expect from these bottles came back.

Previously I had cleaned the bottles with a brush but that didn't work. Using a sponge did. It is something so simple, and yet I did not consider it. If you don't like the taste of a bottle try cleaning with a sponge. My one litre bottle lives inside a neoprene sleeve so although it has been smashed about over the years it still has no scratches on it, despite hiking, climbing, via ferrata, conferences, work and more.

Forgetting to Track a Walk
--------------------------

Today I went through the motions of tracking the walk and I thought I had started the tracker but when I went to stop tracking as I arrived home I noticed that either I forgot, or I pressed the wrong button. Before the pandemic, and even slightly into the pandemic I would have been annoyed not to have a perfect record of my walks and activities. One and a half years into a pandemic I don't care. I stopped using Strava because I grew tired of seeing who was ignoring common decency by not self-isolating locally.

I also do the same activities day after day, for years in a row. It isn't interesting. There is no mystery. I also have no link with people doing group activities. People who do city things have returned to their old habits, but I see that group sports have not returned. The pandemic is still too volatile for things to be as they were.

Although I forgot to "track" my walk it is still logged as steps, heart beat and more. The effort is logged, but it's not visual.
