"...the Tour is a celebration of Zwift and the worlds within. You’ll experience the best of Zwift, together with thousands of people riding by your side. It’s not a race, but a giant party on wheels and a great way to experience Zwift."

This event is different from others in that it spans several days. It also varies from other events in that the range is from 1-4 watts per kilo for A, B and C categories. Category A is the long distance course for women and men. B is the short distance for women and men. Category C is a Women's only category.

So far the experience of riding these events has been fun. I have also rode in other events in the gaps between TDZ events and I'm happy to have the occasional sprint or climb to do. I look forward to going up the Alpe De Zwift yet again. You're not riding in the real world and you can't really converse with people but it's fun to have a group to keep up with, or a group in the distance to catch up with. I look forward to the last four stages.
