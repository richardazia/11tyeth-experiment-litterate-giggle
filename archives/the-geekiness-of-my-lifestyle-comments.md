I'm still active on Jaiku, plurk and friendfeed but I need a break from twitter. I played my best game of pool yesterday, possibly thanks to not thinking of twitter.  
  
I'll be back on that network on the 14th of February but there is a good chance that I will no longer follow quite a few twitter users, especially those that do nothing but tweet how great what they're working on.
