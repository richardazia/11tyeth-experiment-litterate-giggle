Flowers, a bale of Hay, and a road less travelled.

I am using the [Trevolution Ultralight Daypack](https://www.sportxx.ch/de/p/491275600000/trevolution-ultralight-daypack) at the moment. It weighs 120 grams and folds small enough to fit in a jeans or jacket pocket for when you're not using it. It also has a volume of 21 litres but I would not use it to carry 20 litres or kilos. It has no zips or moving parts. It has two side pockets, one for a water container, and the second for the phone charger. The main pocket is accessed through the top and uses a folding system. You fold at least three times and then cloes the clips.

It also has zip cord at the front for a helmet or other voluminous object you might want to carry. I walk every day so it's nice to have a light bag that you can forget you're carrying. It's also nice to have the flexibility to fold it away and forget about it until you need it.

Your first thought when you see the image is that it was taken at an angle, clumsily, and without any attention. In reality it's the hay bale that was placed in the wrong place and rolled down to hit a pole.

The weather was good today. It was warm, it was dry. It felt like a summer's afternoon or evening, as is clearly evidenced by how many people are out doing things in the evenings. It is a great day to spend time outdoors.

Today I experimented with the Camelbak chute system to see how it differed from the Eddy+. The two differences are that

A)It's half the price

B)It's a very quick system for drinking

If water is plentiful then the chute is good, but if you're trying to conserve water try the Chute system.
