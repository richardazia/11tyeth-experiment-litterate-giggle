When I saw the [Wired headline](http://www.wired.com/2016/08/do-movies-still-matter-2016/?mbid=social_fb) below I was happily going to say that I haven't been to see a film at the cinema in years but that isn't strictly true. As you have seen from my blog I have been an active appreciator of independent films. I was at [FIFAD](http://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/fifad-day-1/) earlier this month and I was at the [Montagne En ScÃ¨ne](http://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/montagne-en-scene-geneve/) a few months ago. I have been to a few film screenings at the Graduate institute among other places. \[caption id="attachment\_3335" align="aligncenter" width="300"\][![I have been to see quite a few films this year](http://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Screen-Shot-2016-08-28-at-15.57.13-300x85.png)](http://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Screen-Shot-2016-08-28-at-15.57.13.png) I have been to see quite a few films this year\[/caption\] I love watching good films and I love going to the cinema but at the moment there isn't a single mainstream film that I want to see. Every single film is filled with CGI and fantasy and as I have joked about why would I spend 25 swiss francs on a film ticket to go to a film screen at a specific time when I could watch youtube gameplay videos and discover the story at the same time as the youtuber. Last week I decided to stop my netflix subscription for two reasons. The first reason is that the content is crap. As they have a selection of films that have recently been shown at the cinema there is nothing that makes me think "That's what I want to spend the next 90 minutes of my life watching. Imagine if Netflix showed more extreme sports, adventure, environmental and other films. Imagine if they showed films that make us dream and aspire to more. Films need to be for other people than sci-fi geeks. They need to be for sports enthusiasts, for people that follow current affairs and for people that live in the real, rather than fictional world. When I was living in the South West of England I went to the cinema ninety times in 9 months and what burned out was not my passion for the cinema but my ability to watch the same story line over and over again. The lack of creativity and originality is destroying people's desire to go to the cinema. I have no reason to go to PathÃ© or other cinema complexes around Geneva because they do not show the films that I want to see. They do not address my niche. Montagne en ScÃ¨ne, FIFAD and I think the Coupe Icare film festival fulfil my desire to watch films. They cover topics that I am either interested in passionate about.  [Les Icares du Cinema 2015](https://vimeo.com/139008434) from [coupeicare](https://vimeo.com/user3933587) on [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com). Doesn't the trailer for the film festival make you want to go? Don't you want to watch people pushing themselves to the limit of their courage and endurance? I watch a trailer for an event like this and I definitely want to go. It fills my desire to challenge myself through the sports I do but also to see beautiful scenery and lanscapes. Why would I want to go and see CGI films when I can see extreme athletes challenge themselves and their equipment to the limits. Watch the video below.  [Coupe Icare 2016](https://vimeo.com/164215591) from [coupeicare](https://vimeo.com/user3933587) on [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com). I watched this video at least twice and you see that whilst hollywood is filling its films with make believe the independent sector is documenting those with a real adventurous spirit. Imagine going to the event for the film festival and staying for the aerobatics. For years now the film industry has been re-hashing the same content with no appreciation of societal changes. As a result they fail to capture our imagination and our desire to spend money. They need to inject new blood and find new creative directions that will make us want to go to the multiplexes rather than independent events. I enjoy the multiplex experience but the content dissuades me.
