Despite the warning that rain would fall after 1700 today we went up to explore the Via Ferrata De Lavanchy. it is a via ferrata that requires a 45 minute walk up hill. You walk up towards a cirque and then turn left and continue upwards through some trees. When you get close to the base of the cliff walk straight up to get to the base of the via ferrata. The via ferrata is simple and short. \[gallery columns="2" ids="2236,2237"\] \[gallery ids="2235,2234,2233,2232,2231,2230,2229,2228,2227,2226,2225,2224"\]
