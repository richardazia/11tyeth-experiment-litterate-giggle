Today I explored the Via Ferrata near the Fort D'Ã©cluse. It is an easy 30 minute drive from Geneva therefore can be done in the morning before an evening shift or in the afternoon after a morning shift. As a side note you can see the TGV coming into and leaving Geneva. \[flickr-gallery mode="photoset" photoset="72157626620791854"\]
