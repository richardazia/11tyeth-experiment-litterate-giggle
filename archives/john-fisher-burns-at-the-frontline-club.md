A few days ago I went to listen to John Fisher Burns, longest serving Western Journalist in Iraq at the frontline club in London. The talk was both informative and interesting. I enjoyed being surrounded by people who knew from personal experience what the situation is in that country. if you'd like to see what the conversaton was about then follow this link and follow the conversation of the evening.
