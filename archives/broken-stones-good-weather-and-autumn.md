Today as I looked at the ground I saw broken stones. The one in the image below is especially beautiful. I don't know why there were more broken stones than usual. It seems that the conditions were right to bring the stones to the surface and for the farmers' machinery to break them all to pieces. It's impressive to see the size of some of the broken stones.

Plenty of broken stones

The leaves have started to turn, as various plants give up on feeding their leaves. They are turning from green to orange, yellow and red. The temperature is comfortable for us, humans, but nature knows. I also looked out of a window earlier and I saw plenty of birds and insects flying around. I don't know why there were so many insects. Birds were happy to have so much food.

Leaves on a wall starting to change colour.

In a shopping centre I saw that you could buy Raclette sets that use tea candle[s to melt cheeese](https://www.galaxus.ch/fr/s2/product/nouvel-mini-easy-appareils-a-raclette-5807737) and I found the idea interesting. Today I googled [these things](https://www.galaxus.ch/fr/s2/product/durabase-raclettegrill-appareils-a-raclette-9972031) and I finally bought one. For 20 CHF there is little risk. The advantage is that once you have one of these you can have an instant and easy meal. Buy the right cheese, a little pepper and you're ready.

And Finally

I still have not used YouTube. I used to spend two to three hours a day watching content on YouTube because I liked what I saw but recently I have felt that the sensationalism and ability to put up with rubbish is to a high a price to pay for using the network.

I did consider using Vimeo because this is a network by people with a passion for the art of video, film and cinema, rather than just a suplemental income. The one drawback is that this content requires focus, attention, and a certain amount of concentration. It feels more like studying than relaxation. I also haven't found the content I want to watch yet.
