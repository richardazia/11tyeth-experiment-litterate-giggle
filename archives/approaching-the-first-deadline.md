It's six weeks into the course and the first deadline is approaching. It's for globalisation and I need to work on it today to save on stress later in the week. I went out to Central London to record some vox pops asking people about myspace. The weather was good and people were quite willing to talk to the camera. In fact, it's quite surprising to see what a high percentage of people accept to talk about. In general, they accept to talk if they know about myspace. I was editing for a few hours on Friday, getting one or two interviews shortened for later in the production. We're missing a lot of footage at the moment. We need to listen to the interviews, see what is mentioned, and according to this decision on what shots best illustrate what is being talked about. I've watched my fourth Broomfield documentary, soldier girls, last night. It's a different style. He's far less visible in front of the camera and it focuses almost entirely on one problem recruit. We only see him at the very end when the problem recruit leaves the service.
