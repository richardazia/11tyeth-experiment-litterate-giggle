Too many video podcasts are badly produced and that is why David Pogue's most [recent episode](http://video.on.nytimes.com/?fr_story=a40868c92f8c3ee60511de11409ffdc5b84c761e) was enjoyable to watch. He has a distinctive style. Whilst most video podcasters are content simply using a fixed camera at a desk he takes the time to create entertaining demonstrations of how the tech he is discussing is interesting.

In one episode he talked about how phones for children were great for some things but let down by others. He demonstrated his frustration at having an iPhone yet [not being able to talk about it](http://nytimes.feedroom.com/index.jsp?fr_story=FRTHEBRAIN201929) because he was under embargo. In one episode he was testing [noise-canceling headphones](http://nytimes.feedroom.com/index.jsp?fr_story=94c66219c58c325afb96fbb8a6cd2f82ee5afc57) and wore all of them at once as he left through the front door of his house. Each of these little acts helped to make his podcast both entertaining and different from others.

In his most recent episode, he brought attention to this fact, claiming that he would do it the same way as other video podcasters. He did do some things in a similar manner but overall he demonstrated creativity. By using cutaway shots and gags he still avoided a static shot of someone talking and even makes his audience laugh. The way he did this was by demonstrating a mallet and a sensor and how you can smash your computer's screen virtually.

It's great to watch these podcasts because they are well shot and thought out.

There are a number of podcasts that I find are lacking in quality. They re shot in high definition but the person is in a studio. In other cases, they perform interviews but use no cut away shots to illustrate the person's character and profession and as a result, the interview is very hard to watch.

We've got great technology at our fingerprints. Almost any computer can now be used for editing and almost every household has at least one video taking device. Everyone has watched hours of television yet people have not learned how to produce videos to the standard that is required to make it entertaining. There is one advantage to today's media landscape.

Those who are good video producers and content creators will attract a wider audience and as a result, may be able to sustain what they are doingÂ  and expand on their initial idea. Quite a few people have made their mark and are now living comfortably thanks to the ideas they have brought to fruition and shared.
