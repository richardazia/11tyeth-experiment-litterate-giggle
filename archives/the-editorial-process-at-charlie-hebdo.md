[Charlie Hebdo, Before the Massacre](http://vimeo.com/116362234) from [The New York Times - Video](http://vimeo.com/newyorktimes) on [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com).

I love this glimpse in to a Charlie Hebdo editorial meeting. I like that we see the creation of caricatures that are now so well known and familiar.
