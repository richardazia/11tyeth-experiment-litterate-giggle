The first tweetup I went to saw a crowd of no more than sixty people. The twestival had many more. Enough to fill the Doon club. So many new faces but not many new people to follow. It's fun to see how big the London twitter community has become. The usual people were there, sizemore, loudmouthman, documentally, danacea weaverluke and a few new faces like digitalmaverick, amandita, Poppyd and a few more people. Some video was shot of the event but I'm not sure by when they'll go up. There was no wifi so no opportunity to do some live streaming. At the same time I'm thinking it's time for a plurk up of the same scale, since for the moment there are so few people. Now it's time for Tuttle.
