Whilst everyone that was present at the Paris Seesmeetup has gone home to their day to day lives the images taken are still doing the rounds. I noticed that two of my images were included in [Loic Le meur's blog](http://www.loiclemeur.com/english/2008/12/the-seesmic-com.html). Normally all the Francofous should be able to name every shown. Can you?[![](http://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/picture-2-290x300.png "picture-2")](http://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/picture-2.png)

Looking forward to many more seesmeetups to come.
