I've spent around twelve hours editing today and it's finally getting to resemble something, as I'd like it to be. It's involved two days of video capture of a variety of material from a number of events around Europe in particular. It's starting to be a good edit. Any creative person will tell you that the hardest part of the work is not the work itself but finding the inspiration and finding how to tell the story the most efficiently. If I understood the brief correctly then the edit I've done should be well accepted. I should find out by tomorrow morning normally. I love the editing phase because it's one of the more creative phases. You've got all the material and it's a matter of sifting through it, finding the best and then applying it to the finished product. If I get good feedback then I'm looking forward to tomorrow.
