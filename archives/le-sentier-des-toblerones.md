Le Sentier des Toblerones [Toblerones Walk](https://vimeo.com/128987920) from [Mainvision](https://vimeo.com/user14581240) on [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com). Hidden among the trees in the Canton de Vaud you can find concrete blocks put there as a defensive line to slow down invading armies. The concrete blocks have a similar shape to chocolate Toblerones. There is a [hiking trail](http://www.toblerones.ch/)Â that you can follow from Bassin down to the lake side. Along the way you can find concrete bunkers camouflaged as houses.
