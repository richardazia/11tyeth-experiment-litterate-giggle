I've been reading about documentary makers and it's interesting. Today I read about several of them, took notes, and explored the ideas that they demonstrate. The one that has confused me is Kossanovksy and his ideas of Dogma. I'm wondering how you do a documentary without having interviews or cutaways. Does he mean that we should not use them gratuitously or in some other manner? I need to do more search on this particular aspect. Once more I've watched Control Room, the documentary about al Jazeera. I found it interesting.
