JSON
----

Today I spent some time expanding my knowledge of JSON because understanding how JSON works, and how it works, opens doors. Every social network allows you to download your file as a JSON file. If you learn how to use JSON you can then re-use your data on a site of your own design, according to your own moral code.

WordPress and Custom HTML
-------------------------

I was also playing with static pages from the older parts of my website and trying to bring them into wordpress and for now it half, rather than fully works. My goal is to be able to have The Romans section with one look, the Geography section with another and the Environmental Systems with a third, to give just two examples. I found something promising but I haven't understood it fully yet. It is a work in progress.

A Centralised Web and WEB 3.0
-----------------------------

People are arguing that the world wide web needs to be decentralised, to become web 3.0 and yet the services we use are more and more centralised. Google, Amazon and Microsoft all have data centres and are getting a stranglehold on hosting and cloud solutions. Solutions like those by Infomaniak are much harder to learn about because they are still a small player, in contrast to the giants.

Facebook went down due to a misconfiguration error and two topics come to mind. The first is that Facebook shouldn't have all three services on the same backbone because it becomes a single point of failure, and that was precisely what the Internet was designed to avoid. The second issue is that behemoths like Facebook should not exist, because they monopolise too much. When they went down IM went down for many, image sharing went down for many, and discussion groups went down for many. For a slice in time the world had to think of an alternative to communicate. Even Facebook had to.

This demonstrates that the Web, when it is too centralised, as it is via Facebook, has become fragile. I don't mention Google, Amazon or Microsoft because they are giants, but they help the little guys be seen. Facebook doesn't. It likes to capture and keep its traffic. We need to keep working on personal websites, to keep the web from being to vulnerable to outages.

And Finally - A Rainy Walk
--------------------------

As is usually the case, I did not set out on my walk in the rain, expecting to get rained on. I set off because although the weather app said there would be rain, did not say that it would be heavy, so I set off and for most of the walk the weather was nice. Not t-shirt weather nice, but bits of sun, and not too cold.

During the walk I took the Sigg original bottle. I put it in my coat pocket and forgot about it. By this I mean that it's so small and light that it doesn't get in the way of walking at full speed for an hour or two. It's a good, small bottle, for when you want a drink, but you're not in the middle of a heatwave.
