Did I mention that I got all the way up to twenty thousand tweets last night? I'm officially a very heavy user of twitter and many people celebrated the event with me in true twitter style. They @ed me. It's not everyday you get to that number. I also seesmiced a few thoughts about twitter which someone can find and link to in the near future. I'm feeling a little lazy in that regard. Also today was my first proper full day of work and it went well. I'm tired as a result and tomorrow should be more fun. See you then.
