What makes the situation in Cairo so interesting is the number of media outlets that you can use as sources. From 24 hour news channels like France 24, Al Jazeera, BBC World and others to individual people with mobile phones. For France 24 you have three languages to chose from, with Al Jazeera to you have three languages to chose from. With Sky News you have the choice between Standard definition and High definition. You have live cameras looking into the square. There is no lag time between the acquisition and distribution of images. There is the challenge of aquiring images from the ground though. Journalists have been attacked, as reported on twitter, and through interviews once they arrive in their home countries. Tweets have told us of arrests of certain individuals, of attacks on certain media offices etc. It means that whilst those within the country may not have access to this information we on the outside see it. One of the aspects that is so interesting is the way in which people have been able to organise themselves.

[Mainstream](http://ti.me/e7qBRj) as well. I am looking forward to the literature that will come out from this event, especially if it successful. Imagine comparing a situation like that of Tomas in "The Unbearable Lightness of Being" to this situation, especially if the end result is greater freedom.
