One evening this week I was walking in the countryside at the foot of the Jura enjoying the evening when I walked by a couple. They were sitting on a bench looking across some fields towards the Mont Blanc, the Alps and of course the Lac LÃ©man. Leaning against the bench were two e-bikes with good suspension. It made me think about retirement and free time. It encouraged me to think about the freedom and pleasure of exploring the landscape on a bike without having to make the same effort as if you were on a conventional bike. I thought of the range it would offer and the gradients you could climb. It would in essence give you the freedom of a car with the practicality of a bike. Of course there is a barrier to enjoying this pass time and that is the price of these bikes. In Switzerland they cost as much as a scooter. They lack the range and flexibility though. Electric bikes, in relation to road bikes are in fact cheap. \[caption id="attachment\_2551" align="aligncenter" width="484"\][![Enjoy some freedom, swap your car for a bike for two weeks ](http://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-15-at-18.50.15.png)](http://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-15-at-18.50.15.png) Enjoy some freedom, swap your car for a bike for two weeks\[/caption\] I already alternate between a car, a scooter and a bike and with the change in weather I prefer the comfort of the car or the speed of a scooter. If it's raining then I would much prefer to use the car. It is a shame that they have this promotion at the end of the pleasant season. If they had this promotion at the beginning of summer then I would have taken advantage of it. I will take this option if they offer it next year.
