I am approaching the five kilometre mark now. I am getting close to being able to run five kilometres in a row once again. It is paradoxical that I find running hard, compared to walking and cycling. I was able to run up to 13 kilometres before. Now I'm aiming for half, to a third less.

If I ran somewhere flat I would find running easier. One of the challenges of running in this landscape is that it undulates. In theory I could also run around in circles like others do. I could run laps, rather than a long circuit but I don't want to run around in circles. I am considering running around in a circle for the 4.8km run. I want to run around in that circle to focus on achieving the distance, rather than struggling to cope with the contours.

I have a tendency to speed up and wind myself, and then I struggle to regain my breath. I don't give in and start walking. I just try to get my breathing and heart rate to lower, without having to stop or slow down. I sped up yesterday because I saw that people were going to cross my route, and I didn't want to get stuck behind them. I succeeded.

I am working on my running ability but I don't think I like running. I find it hard. I don't find it relaxing. I have been reading about the 80/20 rule of training, and it's good to know about it, but it doesn't apply to me yet. I am not a runner so all runs are beyond comfortable talking pace, for the moment. With time I will slow down my fitness will increase and walking and talking will be simple.

For now the goal is to reach 5km in a single run. Once I reach the desired distance I will work on feeling more comfortable running that distance, as well as work on speed.

I wish I was more inspired to write better posts, but that will come. We are still in winter and when I start going for more interesting activities my post worthiness will increase.
