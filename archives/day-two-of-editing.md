And there we have it. Day two of editing is over and we're up to five minutes with a script that's ready to be fleshed out by a variety of interviews. I love editing and whilst writing this I'm beginning to look forward to tomorrow's editing. The problem is that I was getting a little tired of being in the same room for so many hours in a day. That'll change tomorrow as new things occur. We've added the sequences to the timeline and it would seem that things are progressing nicely. I have captured the making-of footage for the multicamera project and that should be fun to edit. It will wait until later in the week when the Documentary edit is closer to completion.
