For two years I've been using twitter and during that time I have spent far too much time on the site. As a result I built many friendships. Always paying attention to twitter, even when mobile was a great way of using twitter in the past, but due to people having less time every day to tweet I am adopting a new twitter usage model. I am now scheduling when I will be active on twitter. If you want to find me and chat on twitter then there are three time slots during the day when I will be monitoring the site. These times are: **0930-1000** **1030-1040** and **1930-2000** Central European time (CET). Now to wait and see whether this promotes more conversation. My twitter account will not come back to life until they allow for the restoring of accounts.
