I downloaded the latest version of the broadcast machine, changed one file and my videos are available to download through itunes for viewing on your video ipods if you have one or on your laptop should this not be the case. This means that if you want to see all my latest work it's as simple as subscribing to the feed and you'll get to see my videos whenever I update them next.
