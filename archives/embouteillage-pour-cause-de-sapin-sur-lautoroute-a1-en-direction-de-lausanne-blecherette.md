I went snowboarding at it was great fun. At some moments the snow was great fun so it felt really good. I love the feeling of snowboarding at a fast rate down ski slopes and keeping up with skiers who don't mind waiting too much. All the snow canons were active because there's a lack of natural precipitation. Some resorts are worried about what to do but as long as it's cool then fake snow can be created to make a base on which for skiers to have fun. It's tomorrow the resorts open properly, when all the tourists arrive. On the way home on the radio I heard there was a traffic jam on the way to lausanne due to a christmas tree being on the road and I burst out laughing. only in Switzerland would you hear such a traffic jam warning.
