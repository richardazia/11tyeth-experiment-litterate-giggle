There are a lot of applications that are available both for the Ipod touch and Iphone and here is a quick run down of applications that you may enjoy using. [MiGhtyDocs](http://www.google.ch/url?sa=t&source=web&ct=res&cd=1&url=http%3A%2F%2Fphobos.apple.com%2FWebObjects%2FMZStore.woa%2Fwa%2FviewSoftware%3Fid%3D287327494%26mt%3D8&ei=1amzSO34I5i60gW_uJzwCA&usg=AFQjCNGOrDOl_wXGzcadIBHBrlNUJ5D2Pg&sig2=WDkK0AdEWRFE7SBGAa_92A) MiGhtyDocs is an application that makes looking at your google documents easy. It allows you to view offline any document that you have consulted on either the touch or the Iphone. It's limited in that you can't do any editing from the device itself. [Twittervision](http://www.google.ch/url?sa=t&source=web&ct=res&cd=2&url=http%3A%2F%2Fphobos.apple.com%2FWebObjects%2FMZStore.woa%2Fwa%2FviewSoftware%3Fid%3D284175601%26mt%3D8&ei=GqyzSMa5Opii0gWSv_DsCA&usg=AFQjCNGZK6q8cNwE2daf020uhrzq3UtUdA&sig2=pp4qVOMNgUxg1I8gebmlZQ) For those that enjoy using twitter and the international aspect this application allows you to see tweets from around the world as they're sent out. It's limited in that you can't yet to select just your friend's tweets. [Tumble](http://www.bitfires.com/tumble.php) Tumble is the companion app to your use of tumblr. If you're taking pictures, finding links you want to share or more it allows you access to the functionality of Tumblr whilst mobile. [LinkedIn](http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=288429040&mt=8) The Linkedin app has four main parts. The first of these is to show your contacts latest' actions on the social networking website. The second option labelled connections shows you everyone that is in your contact book. Click on any contact and you get a few extra details. The third option is search if you're looking for something specific. The final icon, the megaphone shows your contact's status, whether they're looking to hire people or any message they may feel like sending. [Newton's cradle](http://www.google.ch/url?sa=t&source=web&ct=res&cd=1&url=http%3A%2F%2Fphobos.apple.com%2FWebObjects%2FMZStore.woa%2Fwa%2FviewSoftware%3Fid%3D288217026%26mt%3D8&ei=9aqzSKiSA4m-0gXC6bDsCA&usg=AFQjCNGJ8B8a81YUlqdP4aunDDa7lZCsHg&sig2=ftwAOgCCVSjjpRnBOtXErw) Newton's cradle is a little bit of fun. As a child we've all played with the cradle. It's the one that has the four balls hanging and the one on one end taps into the three others and only the third bounces away. It detects the attitude of the device and can be a nice method of procrastination [Audi A4](http://www.google.ch/url?sa=t&source=web&ct=res&cd=1&url=http%3A%2F%2Fphobos.apple.com%2FWebObjects%2FMZStore.woa%2Fwa%2FviewSoftware%3Fid%3D288419967%26mt%3D8&ei=EauzSPvRNJLO0gWQ0_zlCA&usg=AFQjCNHpblWLMQ07wi3YzmFwg3x3KoY1IQ&sig2=RaaMfHIRrb2GGYsYJa6yUA) The audi a4 game is a blatant bit of advertising. It's a driving game and the controls are very simple. Right pedal for acceleration, left pedal to break. You control the car by tilting the phone either to the right or left. It's not that hard to play and it won't be such a challenge to get the hang of the controls. [Labyrinth LE](http://www.google.ch/url?sa=t&source=web&ct=res&cd=6&url=http%3A%2F%2Fphobos.apple.com%2FWebObjects%2FMZStore.woa%2Fwa%2FviewSoftware%3Fid%3D284940503%26mt%3D8&ei=M6uzSI2OB4_S0QXw2eDlCA&usg=AFQjCNFz3FLe9sSAdlCZmZ8xCgqgRZFMkA&sig2=XuL_RyLF-9uyqFgEB0yMeQ) Labyrinth LE is that platform you played with as a child. It's a plank of wood with holes and walls. As you tilt the plank of wood (iphone or ipod touch) so the ball rolls with gravity. The tilt sensors work well on this game and it's another way of making those moments of inactivity less boring. Pyramid Lite Pyramid lite is a card game where the aim is to add two cards together to get to a total of 13. [Gottago](http://www.google.ch/url?sa=t&source=web&ct=res&cd=2&url=http%3A%2F%2Fphobos.apple.com%2FWebObjects%2FMZStore.woa%2Fwa%2FviewSoftware%3Fid%3D285851523%26mt%3D8&ei=XquzSJTOLpW60gXy9dTiCA&usg=AFQjCNEWBzCoqkLX5L25Q-_a0pyQeY-HPg&sig2=OLTeW1KoWxOgXLvIAWpxCQ) Gottago makes it easy for you to plan your trips both within Switzerland and to outside. Select the city you're leaving from and the city you want to get to. Do a quick search and it will provide you with a number of routes you can take. [SBBTimetable](http://www.google.ch/url?sa=t&source=web&ct=res&cd=2&url=http%3A%2F%2Fphobos.apple.com%2FWebObjects%2FMZStore.woa%2Fwa%2FviewSoftware%3Fid%3D287762486%26mt%3D8&ei=iKuzSI2jDIzS0QXzzYT1CA&usg=AFQjCNG3mQITXoJKrf324xHovpFd-k20ZA&sig2=EJuae7nmzG9eWkpmUWUmvg) It's the same as gottago but by the CFF/SBB. [Speedtest](http://www.google.ch/url?sa=t&source=web&ct=res&cd=6&url=http%3A%2F%2Fphobos.apple.com%2FWebObjects%2FMZStore.woa%2Fwa%2FviewSoftware%3Fid%3D286356274%26mt%3D8&ei=pquzSL6-NImi0gXL1bjzCA&usg=AFQjCNF2VeHzezl3tePRs3lwnB4cZLhVxA&sig2=j7bznSb42HmDK7xMifBJBg) This is an application that allows you to test the connection speed of whatever you're using to surf the web from on the ipod touch or iphone.
