I'm only a few words away from the completion of the dissertation but over the past two nights I haven't had as much sleep as I would like to have had, thanks one night to myself and thanks the next night, to the people I'm living with. It's a problem when you're kept awake till 4 am and sometimes I wonder whether I shouldn't take a hotel room and sleep there every few nights, just to catch up on the lack of sleep. of course it's a waste of money so I would prefer not to.
