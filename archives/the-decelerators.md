[The Decelerators](http://vimeo.com/48492387) from [Mark Slutsky](http://vimeo.com/markslutsky) on [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com).

An interesting look at life and the moment that people choose to remain in. They say that it's about time, but for me it's about a sentiment. It's about life and how it continues and as everyone else reaches their stop we feel that we are left alone. It is not about solitude but rather about finding the moment that we want to preserve. Not Nostalgia, as the moment is preserved.
