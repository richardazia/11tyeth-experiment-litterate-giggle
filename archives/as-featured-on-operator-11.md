After a long but great day of work I came home to do The Twitter Vox show with Loudmouthman and two guests. We were joined by [Goldie Katsu](http://twitter.com/goldiekatsu) and [Malburns](http://twitter.com/malburns). We discussed what it's like to reach 3000 tweets and the conversation moved towards the advantages of using twitter when part of global communities like Second Life. We had some interesting insights and the conversation progressed well. It's a good show and can be found [here](http://operator11.com/shows/3235/episodes/13881). 

**additionaly the show was featured on the front page of operator 11.**
