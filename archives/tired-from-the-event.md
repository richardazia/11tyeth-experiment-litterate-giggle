It's been a good evening at Podcampuk. The afternoon's sessions were quite funny and the band was good. I enjoyed filming the band thanks to the diversity of shots I could aim to get. We had some interesting interviews of which two were with teachers. One was a University level professor whilst the other was a teacher for 7 year old children. The children were podcasting for students in Australia as well as America therefore we see a nicely different use of the medium. This topic never ceases to surprise people. It's been a good complete weekend night and whilst I enjoy podcamp UK I do want to have a rest at home. There's nothing nicer than getting back from a trip and dumping the bag in your bedroom and walking around feeling much lighter.
