[The Last Ice Merchant (El Ãšltimo Hielero)](http://vimeo.com/66507747) from [Sandy Patch](http://vimeo.com/user10685671) on [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com).

The beauty of documentary film making is that it allows us to capture and preserve an old way of life so that future generations may watch and see professions that are no longer carried out. This documentary about the last ice merchant is an interesting look at a job that people across the world would do. I appreciate that one of these individuals took up construction and the next one took up ice cream making instead. The image of that old man holding his raspberry ice cream is a nice one.
