It was lovely last night, I'm surprised your up and logging so early today though...you had quite a bit to drink ;-) Maybe Trafalgar Square has that effect on you!

Well it all ended in tears for me actually as I was locked out of the flat and was pretty stranded til my boyfriend actually woke up and let me in...about 2am. It was a nightmare!

For the moment plurk ups don't exist, probably won't until there are enough users for a meetup of plurk users to take place. As to the tuttle that's a meeting of social media people in London, Brighton or birmingham. It's a good event to go to if you're looking for conversation, business opportunities and more. It's a bit like social media cafe but for Europe.
