I'm still playing with trendio and I've had a nice increase over the past week with the stock value. It's not monetary but I have finally started to make some "profit". It's gone up by 16 percent in a week.[](http://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/06/good.jpg "Stocks on trendio go up")

I need to keep it increasing more so I need to keep watching to see which are the best words to get.
