There is a hill that is steep. You often see people struggle up it, trying to beat their own records and in so doing get knackered by the top. Yesterday I went up such a hill and I felt low on energy so I didn't bother to sprint. I just focued on getting up to the top. As I went I saw a group of runners running down towards me and I wanted to take a picture but I was too slow so I took a picture of my shadow as I cycled instead.

The front wheel of my bike and my shadow.

I showed the bison road to someone else. I think it would be a good place to walk or cycle, if people have the motivation, and the range.
