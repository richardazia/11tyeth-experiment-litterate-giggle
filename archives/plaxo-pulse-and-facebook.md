For all of those privacy advocates I'm on your side for this issue. With a lot of communitis you create a profile and friends can see it. What you give them are both your name and possibly phone number but no more. When you're building a database of contacts you must ask for it. When you add friends to outlook, address and other applications you've done research and the users have given their consent. That's not the same as harvesting them direct from facebook. No one said they wanted you to have their e-mail address. No one chose to give you those details. If you want them ask for them. Taking contact details from 5000 people is unethical and wrong. That's very similar to spam behaviour. What makes this worse is that Plaxo is associated with this. I use Plaxo pulse and you can see it on the right side of this column.Â  I don't mind their services but for people to harvest their friend's data without prior consent will help increase this feeling of insecurity. We've had that debate on Seesmic, on Facebook and other online communities. If we want real communities transparency and trust are key. Stop abusing it.
