Nights in halls are like nights out in the Savannah. Since the drunk party sound coming through walls is a given that's the sound of crickets and frogs. It's constantly there and theoretically you should eventually learn to sleep through it over time. Of course it's not quite constant enough. Then you've got the sound of banging and shuffling from the kitchen. Now that sound is the thunder storms and rain that will come over and wake you, soak you and make you wish you had a friendly cave to crawl into for shelter. The third one are lions and hyenas, high up on the food chain and the most nefarious to your health should you not be careful. That's the argumentative drunks often found before day break. With these there's nothing you can do but make sure you've found somewhere safe to hide away, grin and bear it. Overall what these three elements mean is one thing, that a proper night of sleep is less likely than snow on the beaches of the South Coast of England.
