Every day I walk around with my TEDxCERN lanyard. TEDxCERN, for me, was an opportunity to listen to seventeen talks in one afternoon without being bored or distracted. Some people spoke well, others were charismatic and one or two were pitching rather than talking. That didn't matter. I enjoyed the event and felt inspired. As the videos are available I will share one of these videos per day until I run out.
