I found yet another toy to play with in the form of [alerthingy](http://alertthingy.com/) and one question springs to mind. Will this one be able to cope with my stream of actions. It's an adobe air interface that allows you to keep track of [friendfeed](http://www.friendfeed.com). I've only started playing with it but it looks like a useful tool for when i'm at home after a day's work.
