This weekend I went by the lac D'annecy where there is a gorge to do some more canyoning. The canyon was quite an easy one but without much light. As a result you get some more interesting images. Here are the images taken with one of my cameras. Pictures taken with the second camera will appear later. \[flickr-gallery mode="photoset" photoset="72157627583713206"\]
