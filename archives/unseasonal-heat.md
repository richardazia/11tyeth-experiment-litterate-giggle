In Austria, there's a pollen warning. Apparently the lack of frost has encouraged the trees and other plants to begin releasing pollen. That's quite amusing. We have the same temperatures in central Europe as you'd expect to have down in the south Israel has seen snow but the resorts can't open because of the lack. Where is winter? Is it hiding in the south? Should people go on skiing holidays with their bikes and hiking boots rather than snowboards and skies? On the Porte du Soleil ski pass you'll see that they advertise their summer time activities like downhill mountain biking.
