[Speed Riding Mont Blanc](http://vimeo.com/36398302) from [Didier Lafond](http://vimeo.com/dlafond) on [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com).

Speed flying is a combination of parapente and skiing. You take off from the top with the parapente and ski part of the way and fly for the rest of the way. This is an extreme sport but it provides some great images. This is a sport I edited footage from a number of times and it captures the imagination.
