These long walks.treks fascinate me as well. I'm not at all religious, but I think the experience of walking for days, stopping in small hotels/B&Bs along the way, connecting with other walkers, would be wonderful. Someday, someday!

The easiest walk to do is the Via Alpina route that starts in Liechtenstein and ends in Montreux. A train ride to the start, and then walk back towards "home". Physically it would be demanding as it is through the Alps, It's around 21 stages.
