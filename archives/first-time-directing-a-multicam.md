Directing a Multicam is easy, after being a cameraman at many conferences. it's a matter of knowing which shots you would like to have had with just one camera but couldn't get. It's easy, switching from one source to another and making sure the pacing is right and that there are not too many screw-ups. Overall it went well and I enjoyed it. It was different today as I was a simple camera operator. I had to concentrate on getting the right shot and fight away the desire to sit down or do something else. On both days the last speaker was the more entertaining of the day.
