Working at the Global Humanitarian Forum today, providing the live streams, was fun as some interesting conversations took place. Among the people present we had Micheline Calmy Rey, Kofi Annan, the writer of the wikonomics book (which I have as an audio book and haven't finished yet), Nik Gowing, and a few more interesting people. Whilst I was working I didn't have time to listen to the discussions that were taking place but they ranged from new media and communication to providing funds for organisations and the aspects to be taken into account, managing displacement, demographic dynamics and many more topics. We'll be streaming quite a few more lives during the course of tomorrow so if you're interested in humanitarian subjects visit [Global Humanitarian Forum](http://www.ghf-geneva.org/) for more information. The live streams can be found by following the Launch Live video link provided on the site.
