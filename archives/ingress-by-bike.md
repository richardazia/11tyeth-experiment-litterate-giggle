Ingress by bike is good when you're in the countryside because it allows you to travel between villages faster than if you were walking and without the carbon footprint of taking the car or a scooter with an internal combustion engine. It also allows you to stop anywhere.

#### Distance Covered

In two hours I travelled about 30 km, which by ordinary cycling standards is slow. I like to cover that distance in about an hour and a half or less. I was able to cover at least six to eight villages and visit portals that I would not overwise visit.

#### New Portal Spotting

During the bike ride I noticed that there were some unmarked portal opportunities. I saw some "borne kilometrique" and border markers that were not listed. The border markers are old stone sculptures where you see VD on one side and FR on the other. In this context FR stands for France, not Fribourg. They're spaced out regularly enough to be justified as portals.

#### Undulating Terrain

The landscape here isn't flat so if you're cycling to play Ingress you sometimes visit portals that are at the bottom of troughs or other hills. You also need to cycle upwards as much as you cycle downwards. As a result it does promote a healthy afternoon of physical exercise. When you sprint between portals you're exerting yourself more than if you were looking down at your phone while walking.

#### Quadlock holder

if you're playing ingress on a bike holding the phone in your hand is dangerous. That's why it makes sense to use something like the [quadlock](https://www.quadlockcase.com/) bike mount. It's easy to install on your bike and when you're playing ingress you clip the phone on, and when you finish it you remove the phone in seconds.

In the past when I've played ingress I kept the phone in my pocket and I had to stop to see if I was close to the next portal or if I wanted to navigate. In this case you're using the Ingress app rather than a cycling app and you spot the field lines and head towards the portal that you either want to capture or link from.

All in all this is a nice way of going for a bike ride somewhere familiar without getting bored by the routine or the 30th time down the same road. It's a nice way of passing an afternoon.
