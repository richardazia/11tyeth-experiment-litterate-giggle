Satellite broadcasting has progressed since I was last able to watch a lot of television. The spacing of channels and the programs have progressed. I've watched France 24, Al Jazeera English and a few more channels. As time is progressing so the channels are re-indexing themselves within the sky digital world. They are no longer organised by the discovery channel. Instead, we find that some of the documentary programs are included within specific interests. In particular, I'm thinking of travel documentaries. They are now cataloged within the travel section of the life and culture channels. It's good because the travelogue documentaries are organised together. It allows for those dreaming of travel to visit these pages. I watched Al Jazeera English and one thing that's marked me is how many short features they have on a number of subjects. They have the everywoman program, the witness, and others. It's a different take than that by BBC World. It's interesting. I want to travel. I don't want to be stuck in uni anymore. I want to go to various locations and do some of these travel documentaries, see different parts of the world. Maybe I will get to Australia in May.
