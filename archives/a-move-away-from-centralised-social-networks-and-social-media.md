Facebook engagement has declined since farmville distracted people away from conversations and towards mindless interactions with games, the sharing of tabloid content and emotional posts. These changes have had an adverse effect on social networks and the way in which we engage with people. I have noted a shift away from individuals towards following "celebrities" and "thought leaders". Rather than interacting with 300 people on your timeline, becoming engaged and getting to know people well we have moved to a "yelling to be noticed" model. I have many thoughts on this topic and will elaborate later. Have you thought about how Ello, App.net and other social networks are trying to do what so many forums and discussion forums did before? They're demonstrating how much context they are lacking. Instead of investing more time with social networks that may never gain traction I'm returning to this blog/website.
