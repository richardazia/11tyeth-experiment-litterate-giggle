Great article, although I think one piece has been neglected. Specific social networks that cater to certain groups of people are gaining ground. For instance, [www.affluence.org](http://www.affluence.org) is a gathering of the world's most wealthy people and [www.divebuddy.com](http://www.divebuddy.com) connects scuba divers.

That's because those are niche websites. There's a chance I may find a use for the scuba diving one though.
