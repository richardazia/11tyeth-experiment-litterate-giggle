In Jerash, there are the remains of a Roman town and that is worth visiting. I went there during the Gulf War in 1991 and saw some huge warehouses built by the Romans to store grain and there is also an amphitheater which was shaped like an ear and I went there and it is built into a hill so that they did not need to build supports in order for it to stand. It is supposed to be so that you can hear the people at the centre of the amphitheater you will hear the person from anywhere in the seating so the acoustics were good.
