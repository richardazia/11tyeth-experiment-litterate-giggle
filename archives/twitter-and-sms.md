Back in the good old days of Twitter the length of a tweet was limited to the length of an SMS. The aim was to make it possible for people to tweet and have conversations using GSM phones. With short messages we could leave the keyboard behind and read messages on our mobile phones.

Jaiku was similar except that it was more advanced, having an app that played well with Symbian devices. With time, and the advent of the iphone and ubiquitous data plans so platforms like Twitter and Jaiku could add images and more. With time Seesmic experimented with video and instagram with images. Instagram thrived because it made uploading and sharing images fast and easy, even in the days of limited bandwidth.

Over the years Twitter and other social media platforms have forgotten about their origins and now a single tweet can take an entire 27" computer monitor, let alone a laptop screen. What was one short and succinct became long winded, and inefficient.

Twitter wants to extend the character limit to 4000 characters, but that's absurd. The entire reason for Twitter being, is to have short messages, that are quick to read, a list of headlines, rather than full blown essays.

Remember that blogging platforms have snippets and sub-headings for a reason, to make them easy to skim.

Twitter has lost its bearings now. They are trying to be different products, at a high price, rather than highlight their unique selling point. I don't want to read long tweets. I want short tweets. I even want to turn off images, to make the feed shorter and more succinct.

I want to joke that the reason for "cargo pants" or cargo trousers as I prefer to call them is to store FFP2 masks during a pandemic. They are the ideal size for masks. It's easy to store them during your outdoors walks, and pull them out once you are back indoors, or near people.
