The Casio GBD-200 and GW-B5600 both have negative displays but the GBD-200 has a display that is much easier to read in low light. The contrast is good enough to read at dusk with the GBD-200 but not the GW-B5600. When backlit both are easy to read.

I chose to wear the GBD-200 today, on a whim.

I will get back to proper blog posts soon.
