For a few days now I've been looking through thousands of pictures to make sure that they're synced from iCloud to the Photo app before they're deleted. In so doing I noticed how far in front of a group I was hiking a few years ago. Instead of hiking with the group I was so far in front that I could get group shots without trying. Eventually, they did pose, as if it had been intentional rather than my walking habit.

What you see in the pictures is that I did stop and I was with the group a lot, waiting for people to catch up, take pictures as they did, and then go fast again. During a more recent hike I found that I was fast until 3000m and then I slowed down to become one of the slowest. I don't know whether it was lack of energy, which it could be, or that I'm not used to being at altitude. This will be especially true this summer after two summers spent at low altitude.

If I was an extrovert I wouldn't be walking at the front of the group taking pictures. I'd be in the middle having conversations, and if I was having conversations then, then I wouldn't be writing so many blog posts now.

Normally I'd look at the images and I'd enjoy them, and that would be it. As tomorrow is the day for Valentine's Day content I can squeeze this post in. It's because I saw a woman smile at the camera in so many images that I wish I had been closer, rather than at a distance. I am thinking of the opportunity I had but didn't consolidate.

It's a cruel paradox of life that we will see the same individuals for years of sporting activities without fail and yet when we're interested we only see them at three or four events. I often joke "everyone I appreciate leaves".

Not that it isn't fun to pretend that I care about Valentine's day for the commercial reason I actually care about the day because back in 2003 I got my driving licence and that was the start of me having the freedom to drive myself without having a passenger. Yes, there is a pun in there. My first drive was to drink hot chocolate with a girlfriend and a best friend, who was also female. That day was special. The freedom of driving a car, the freedom of the open road, the freedom not to wait for a train or a bus. The freedom to have all of the adventures that I write about in this blog.

I could write more but I think it's time for me to go for a virtual bike ride as it's windy and rainy out in the real world.
