Last night I went to the [Kendra event](http://www.kendra.org.uk/wiki/wiki.pl?KendraParty20071012) not knowing what to expect from the event. It started at 6pm and ended by 9pm and i had the opportunity to meet with a few people of which Brendon Kenny of VK media and the [Jummp project](http://www.jummp.net/).

_A large amount of metadata is currently being discarded without understanding its value! JuMMp aims to promote interoperability for metadata and signalling information exchange. This will enable contextual navigation within live and recorded content for users of digital devices such as PVRs, games consoles, mobile phones and computers â€“ providing value to end users and to all stakeholders in the content chain._

It's an interesting project and you can participate in the conversaton and learn more through their [facebook group.](http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=4281024011&ref=mf) It's an interesting project with some very interesting backers so I look forward to seeing how they implement this in the wild.

Other people I met with are Mark and Alex of [Astream](http://www.astream.com/) - a streaming service provider, Darren of Ioda, an independent online distribution Alliance and Dennis of [zzizzlfilm](http://www.zzizzlfilms.com/) - short film distribution for filmmakers by filmmakers. I was also introduced to Nick, product development Director for Bsky and a few more people.

It was a good event with many interesting people to meet and whenever the next event is organised I will make sure to turn up.
