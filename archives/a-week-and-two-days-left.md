There are about nine days left before the deadline and I'm up to revision five of my dissertation and I'm feeling fairly happy about it. i've spent two days working off the printed copy before transferring these changes back to the electronic version. I've got almost everything I wanted to do done for today. The next step is to get all the graphics, tables and the bibliography in order. In this detail alone I may expect to spend two or three hours if things go well. I'm happy to have got this far as I can still change anything that i feel really needs changing.  Tomorrow I may attempt a smooth read, making sure that everything isÂ  as it should be.
