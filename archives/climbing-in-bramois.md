Climbing in Bramois is a pleasant and practical experience.Â This is a climbing area with numerousÂ walls and routes. There are single and multipitch routes ranging from 3-4 up to 7 and 8. The climbing area is within a gorge with nice rock on both side and a river running through the middle. Â This area has over 150 routes from which for you to choose from. The routes vary in length from 10-40 metres for single pitch routes. When I was there I climbed around the Africa wall.Â There are quite a few 5a and above routes. Some of these routes are more instinctive than others. There is one particular route where we had a tendency within the group to go too far too the right and then had to go left and then make it up to a crack. Once the complicated bit was negotiated the rest of the climb was easy. I am still getting used to climbing on rock rather than on an artificial wall or via ferrata. I later went to another wall a few minutes walk away and that climb was more interesting because it was up a chimney and some bits were mild overhangs that could be negotiated with observation. That wall was fun to climb. For more information about the climbing walls you can visit [this site](https://www.thecrag.com/climbing/switzerland/bramois/guide). The advantage of this climbing area is that multiple groups can be present at once and climb without getting in each others way. You have a variety of climbing routes and experiences and getting around is easy if you don't mind walking up and down short trails.Â I will be tempted to climb around this area many more times in future. The climbing season is coming to an end for this year but I do plan on climbing here again next year. With the people whom I drove to the site we climbed until the sun had left the valley.
