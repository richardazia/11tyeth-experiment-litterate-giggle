[Au Vieux Campeur](http://www.auvieuxcampeur.fr/) held the summer mountain film screening event at the Batiment des Forces Motrices in Geneva. They introduced the event as being the opportunity for them to share the passion of the mountains with people who may not be aware of the activities that are possible. They then went on to say "but as we're having the screening in Geneva we know that you're just half an hour from the mountains so many of you are practitioners and today we may even have participants from the [cancelled Patrouille Des Glaciers](http://www.tdg.ch/sports/actu/patrouille-glaciers-suspendue-caprices-ciel/story/19699071). \[caption id="attachment\_2843" align="aligncenter" width="300"\][![Mountain film screening](http://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/12771656_951514888259242_5782041803772493801_o-300x169.jpg)](http://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/12771656_951514888259242_5782041803772493801_o.jpg) Montagne en ScÃ¨ne, four films screened at the BFM buildling in Geneva\[/caption\] Four films were shown at [Montagne En ScÃ¨ne](https://www.facebook.com/events/1547310642263926/). The films shown were A Line Across the Sky, a documentary following two less experienced climbers as they attempt the Fitzroy traverse during a rare good weather window, Chasing Niagra, a documentary about Rafa Ortiz and his preparations to shoot the Niagra Falls in a Kayak. The third film is Mont Rebei Project, a documentary looking to achieve a new Rope Jump record. The Last film, and my favourite is Valley Uprising. It takes a look at the American climbing scene from the fiftiesÂ up to the Modern day. This documentary is great because it provides us with a deep understanding of the American climbing psyche. Mountain climbing is a sport of passion and so to see how different groups helped this passion progress over the years is interesting. [Film screenings](http://www.montagne-en-scene.com/#!villesetapes/zp51n) are in Switzerland, France and Belgium
