[ChilloutÂ®](http://chillout2.dmpf.org/wordpress/?page_id=25) is an open source implementation of the [DMP](http://www.dmpf.org/) [DRM](http://www.dmpf.org/project/ga15/idp-30.html) software. The idea is to create a multiplatform toolkit that allows for the easy managment of rights for media files. Built with Java it has several levels of rights managment for a number of files. This includes encrytion software and more. For a PDF document of what I saw today it's available [here](http://chillout2.dmpf.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/talk-on-chillout-the-reference-software-for-dmp.pdf).
