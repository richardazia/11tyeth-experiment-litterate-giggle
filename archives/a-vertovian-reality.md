Look up Dziga Vertov and his ideas, then look at this video. Thinking of the documentary makers and their discussion about catching life unawares, getting real life to happen without the person knowing. It's the creative treatment of actuality. That's more Griersonian (if I remember right).  Everyone has a camera on them and certain of us stream it from where we are. Now it's time for the documentation of a society through audiovisual means for future generations to puzzle over.
