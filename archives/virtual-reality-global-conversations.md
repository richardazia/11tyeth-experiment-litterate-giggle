In the mid 1990s I spent hours and hours in chatrooms. In some cases I spent so long in chatrooms that I saw Australia and Asia get ready for bed, Moscow and Europe wake up and then the US wake up. That was my first glimpse of the globalisation of conversations in real time. It was text based and everyone was on dial up modems therefore every minute spent online cost money.
