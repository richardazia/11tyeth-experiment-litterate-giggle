Climbing is in our genes. We were monkeys after all, generations ago. If you're lucky enough to start climbing at a young age then you can resemble the girl from this video. Climbing is fun. It's a great way to see beautiful landscapes. The Via ferrata season should be around soon and I'll be back in the mountains every week when the weather allows.
