According to a [Le Matin article](http://www.lematin.ch/fr/actu/economie/l-iphone-debarque-cet-ete-en-suisse_11-151466) the Iphone will come to switzerland. It's the 3g version of course so for those that have been patient this should be a fun time. I see no mention of cheaper dataplans as of yet but it's an interesting time for those creating mobile video content. It's also a new version of mobile web browsing.
