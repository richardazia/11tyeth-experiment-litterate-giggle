[Vimeo On Demand: Sell your work, your way](http://vimeo.com/61103187) from [Vimeo Staff](http://vimeo.com/staff) on [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com).

Equipment is going down in price and information on how to produce good quality content is spreading. As a result of both these trends people like Vimeo and youtube can take advantage of the shift. Applying to work for mainstream media is no longer a must. What you do need to find are the right people with the right motivation to work alongside you. Once that is done the next steps are simpler.
