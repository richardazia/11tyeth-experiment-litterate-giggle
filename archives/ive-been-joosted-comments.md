Hey I would love an invite if you have an extra one. I have been hearing a lot about joost and it seems that either people love it or hate it and I would love to see for myself. thanks pltaylor3 at gmail.com

Think it's according to IP therefore it can only be used once. If I download the joost software both for PC and mac maybe I can login and offer some invites. Problem is I won't get to a pc for a few more weeks.

You know, I would offer you an invite but unless I can launch joost I can't log into the website unfortunatly.
