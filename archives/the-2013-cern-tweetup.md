On the 27th of September CERN invited twelve Social media users to a tweetup. I was among those twelve. We had the rare opportunity to go down and see the tunnels where the LHC carries out it's experiements. We met with World Wide Web pioneers and we got to listen to interesting experimental and theoretical scientists. This weekend anyone in the area can go to CERN and speak with the scientists in person and see the tools being used for the experiments we have heard so much about over the years. \[gallery ids="1872,1873,1874,1875,1876,1877,1878,1879,1880,1881,1882,1883,1884,1885,1886,1887,1888,1889,1890,1892,1893,1894,1895,1896,1897,1898,1899,1900,1901,1902,1891"\]
