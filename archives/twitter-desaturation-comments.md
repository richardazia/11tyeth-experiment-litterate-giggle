We all use twitter differently, but to me it's a two-way deal. There are people I follow who don't follow me back - but they're senior and respected members of he community from whom I've learned a great deal. Otherwise, the conversation, the interaction IS the community and unless it's two-way, then I do find it pointless... ...feels like standing outside a room with your ear pressed to the door - uncomfortable and pointless!

I think that is right. Although I don't see it changing because even now that I see that happen, I still see more of the other aspects of twitter like a quick news channel, a discussion, just a feed of events or happenings, etc... Although I do think it has become a bit more morbid in nature, people say when they are brushing they teeth and whatnot, but still I think that is a reflection of how twitter has embedded itself in the pop-cyber culture. But yeah, that may mean that you need to desaturate your twitter.
