Being a resident assistant is a great job at the same time as it's a lot of responsibility. It means that we have access to every room in halls for a few hours a week although in reality we're only allowed to go from one room to another. We have to go around making sure that everyone is ok. We check that all kitchens are in a good state and that people are not unhappy. What becomes a challenge is asserting authority without getting everyone to hate you. On the one hand, you're a third year, which means you've had a lot of parties already and you've been weathered into uni life and on the other, you're still in need of social interactions. I went to my first lecture and I remembered how much I hate being in a classroom surrounded by so many people. It was a documentary module and this should be fun. We've got a week to think of a topic to research and carry on. In a few days, I'll be going to America and I'm looking forward to it more and more. I'm excited about traveling to the Big Apple, seeing all those tall buildings, and more.
