Whilst I listened to [MrTweet](http://www.mrtweet.com) speaking on the [Net@Nite](http://twit.tv/natn) podcast from several month ago I found it interesting that he spoke of the [re-tweet](http://www.retweet.com/) as giving credit to those you follow who share some interesting links. If you spend a lot of time on twitter though after seeing the same retweet too many times you may not follow them anymore. What I propose is to use MrTweet's recommendation instead. The process is simple. Go to a [profile page](http://mrtweet.net/warzabidul?t) and you can see two things. You can see who has recommended you (me) or who you have recommended. If you're a twitter Veteran like those I follow and I then you don't need MrTweet but if you like my blogging and tweet style then by seeing who I recommend you can find more relevant people to your twitter stream. As a result you will be following a group of friends rather than random strangers. As a result that sense of community will remain strong.
