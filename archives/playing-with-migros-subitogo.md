Yesterday I tried playing with Migros SubitoGo and the experience was good. You scan the QR code for the shop as you enter and then you scan the products that you want to buy. I kept them in my hands until I got to the checkout counters.

Passabene
---------

With Passabene you shop, you scan your products, and then you go to the cash machine, scan the shopping list to the device, and it charges you. It's quite conventional and sometimes it asks for a double check from a cashier.

Subito Go
---------

With the Subito Go app you can scan what you're buying, put it in your bag and then choose to pay, and you can pay for what you bought, from anywhere in the store, if you are so inclined, via Twint and more.

A Strange Feeling
-----------------

It feels strange to pick things up, scan them, pick up more things, scan them, and then to pay directly from your phone, without using any shop device. In future I can walk into a shop, scan what I want to buy, put it in my bag, pay for it and walk out without stopping, at the checkout, without a cashier seeing me motion that I am paying.

A System of Trust
-----------------

This works for one simple reason. Societal trust. If and when a society behaves morally then people can be trusted to walk into a shop, pick things up, and pay for them, before leaving. I read about this type of shopping in Switzerland but I had not played with it in Switzerland yet. Now that I have, I like it.

Phone Batteries
---------------

The SubitoGo app is within the Migros app. It uses the phone's camera to scan products. It works well but it's better to use it with a well charged battery. It used about 8 percent for 27 minutes on my phone.

The Moral Side
--------------

People do not like self-checkout and other such tech because they feel that it removes jobs from shops. I don't think that it does, because shelves still need to be stacked. Instead of being stuck in one place shop workers are constantly walking around and filling shelves.

I often see that the people standing by self-checkout machines are having conversations with friends. They interrupt the conversation, if someone needs assistance, but the rest of the time they chat, like bar staff in bars, on a quiet day.

Some jobs are fun. I think that sitting at a cash register, on a quiet day, without customers is boring. On such days I am sure that they prefer self-checkout, where they are there in case of a problem.
