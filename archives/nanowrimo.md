This month I'm trying something different. It's [Nanowrimo](http://www.nanowrimo.org/). It's a strange word for the unitiated but it's short for National novel writing month. It's the time of the year when people around the world set themselves the goal of writing 50,000 words without proofreading. The idea is to produce as much writing as possible during this month. It's next time that the challenge of editing takes place.
