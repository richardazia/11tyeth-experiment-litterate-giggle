There is nothing more aggressive or stressful than being woken up by heavy metal. There is nothing but some idiot yelling into a microphone and other idiots calling it music. It's not music so much as noise to me. I'd prefer to be woken to the sound of seagulls or the waves than music created by the disenfranchised youth of a bygone era. In halls causes for being pulled from your sleep are numerous. On many occasions it's people yelling from outside to windows, cleaning staff talking loud to each other, girls talking about subjects that would later embarrass them (hilarious though), and the clanking sound of kitchen utensils. There's the sound of cupboards being opened and closed, of fire alarms, demolition, grating barriers and more. I can't think of anymore but those are a great method by which to make me appreciate the countryside all that much more. Nothing but the sweet sound of birds and wind in the branches, storm clouds, and more. Any noise that is not the result of some selfish person I do not mind.
