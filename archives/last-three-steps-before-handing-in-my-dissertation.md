Being at the stage I'm at, and having discussed the work with the tutor there are three things I must make sure to do before handing in the work. The first task is uniformity. I need to go through two or three sections and make sure that I tie them into the overall structure of the dissertation work. It's meant to flow from one section to another. That's something I've got to work on. The second thing I've got to work on one or two paragraphs, make sure that the information that I wrote down is comprehensive and there's no so what question left in the air. The final task is to make sure that I have a clear dissertation title and write the dissertation conclusion according to this. Once that's done I'm pretty much done with this most major of assignments and it's been a great learning curve. I think it's been the best learning experience overall that I've had in University.
