The media is in a time of convergence and that's what some people find fascinating. i'm listening to a number of podcasts about technology, the media and computing in order to keep informed on developments. Today I will be working once again with footage that has been shot in another country. What makes this particularly interesting is that the footage is coming from Hungary whilst I will be in Switzerland. I will see the races take place, then I will cut the video, add some text and upload it to a website. This is similar to what you'd expect to find on a variety of websites. Once the event has been finished for a week or two I may take one or two of the edits and upload them as part of my showreel.
