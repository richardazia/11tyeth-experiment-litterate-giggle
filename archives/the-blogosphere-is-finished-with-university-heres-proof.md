Here is some evidence to demonstrate that I am not the only one to have finished university and there are a lot of really happy people around. I've been so lazy for the past two days because I can. Nothing is hanging over me anymore so I'm taking advantage of this fact. When Monday comes I'll start being productive again but it's time for a well-deserved break. Been listening through half of the top 200 songs of 1990 to 2000 already.
