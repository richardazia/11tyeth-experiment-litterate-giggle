Twitter went down and I didn't notice, yet again. [According to The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/6/23627875/twitter-outage-how-it-happened-engineer-api-shut-down) it has been down five times in five weeks. It goes down so regularly that it feels as if they have allowed the Netflix Chaos Monkey to run freely around Twitter code. They say that they need to rewrite the entire site.

Twitter had plenty of downtime many years ago but these were growing problems that were eventually resolved. It would go for months or even seasons without serious issues. They had learned how to make Twitter reliable. Now that so many staff have been fired the people with less experienced are stuck, trying to understand the old logic, and failing.

They want to rewrite the entire website. I wish them good luck. I don't see how they can when they're firing people, and overloading those that are left behind, with work.

Google Reader, Jaiku, and plenty of services have lived, thrived and eventually been abandonned. Twitter is not something I rely on anymore, so whether it lives or dies, at this point, doesn't matter.

I am no longer invested in the social network. I am no longer invested in social media, because social media has shown that it is a glossy mag, rather than a social network. Glossy mags are not social networks. They are advert sellers. I loved Twitter. I expect nothing now.

And Finally
-----------

I don't want to use Twitter anymore for the same reason I stopped using Facebook and Instagram. I don't trust those in charge to be moral. I expect that our data and attention will be exploited. We will be used.

I am not a user. I am a community member. Destroy the community, like you did with Facebook and Instagram, and I will migrate.

My issue with Twitter is not that it goes down, but why it goes down. I also have issue with who owns and controls it. No social network should be controlled by the Far Right, especially when algorithms affect what you see.
