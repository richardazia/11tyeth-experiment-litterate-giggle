Hi Friend!  
  
Do you know any of my friends? Maybe you want to become friends with them as well?

I have connected with my friends using **WordPress** and the **Friends plugin**. This means I can share private posts with just my friends while keeping my data under control. If you also have a WordPress site with the friends plugin, you can send me a friend request. If not, get your own [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) now, install the [Friends plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/friends/), and follow me!

Enter your blog URL to join my network. [Learn more](https://wpfriends.at/follow-me)
