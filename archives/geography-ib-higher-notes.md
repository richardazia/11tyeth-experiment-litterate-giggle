In Geography during the first year we studied PUDA, this is how I refer to Population, Urbanisation Development and Agriculture. As to this year we are studying physical geography.

I enjoy Geography because I have seen many of the features we talk about in geography and because it is almost present in some form on the news this is one of the easiest topics I know where you can develop a good knowledge without to much work.
