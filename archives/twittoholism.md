Twittoholism is seeing the world through twitter. Rather than reading newspapers, books and other intellectual adventures you see the world through what others are twittering about. It' a bit like a chatroom but you take this one with you wherever you go, from your bedroom to the living room, across town on the bus and even to your computer. As you get a greater diversity of people so your twitterfull existence progresses exponentially.
