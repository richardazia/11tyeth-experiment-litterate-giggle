I used to really like YouTube. It was a place where normal people could share videos of their normal lives, for normal people to enjoy, and to discover organically. Today YouTube is a way of forcing people to watch adverts before watching content that has been seen half a million to a million times by people with a million subscribers who keep saying "i have a million subscribers" and showing off. This makes most YouTube content unpleasant.

Don't boast about your audience, or about your community. Give me good quality video content that I want to keep watching. Give me content, not boasting about how you got awards, got a big audience etc. I am not on YouTube to flatter your ego. I am on YouTube to watch content that is interesting as I eat dinner. If you don't fill this niche then I can slide towards another content creator, or video network.

Content viewing, at this point in the pandemic has become hard. If the content is about friends and family then this is a long distant memory, in the middle of the pandemic, with no hope of an end.

Documentaries would be fun, if they weren't edited by a hyperactive bumblebee. If I watch a documentary, speak, give me information, and don't sensationalise it. If you do I will tune out within minutes, or even seconds in some cases.

I would watch films but either modern story writing makes them so dull that I lose interest within a few minutes, or they make me long for pre-pandemic, or post pandemic life.

Content is not made for single people living in solitude during a pandemic but it should. Good documentaries, good films, good series.

I enjoyed watching people play computer games for a while, but then eventually I grew tired of the content. I felt that at least one or two people were playing towards a stereotype, rather than being genuine, Eventually I stopped watching.

I often listen to audible books as I cook. Recently I thought about listening to audiobooks as I ate, or even in the evening, rather than watch video content. The beauty of audio books is that they're 3-20hours long. Find a good book and you will be entertained for a week to 20 days.

Recently I have been listening to Louis L'amour books and I find them fun. They're not the genre I used to listen to. I am in the right frame of mind. I like these books because they're light, easy reading. They're not like Gulag, or other books. It's a trip back in time to frontier America, when bison were plentiful, land was being taken away by the Whites, and more.

As I read Louis L'Amour I know that some topics may anger or frustrate people who feel that the writing is from another age, and it is. Listening to such books is a cultural trip to see what life was hypothetically like, and to explore a different genre. I usually read factual books.
