I recently dropped by the [Frontline club](http://www.frontlineclub.com/) to listen to what [Andrew Keen](http://www.frontlineclub.com/club_events.php?day=2007-09-06) had to say and his talk was really interesting. There are a few ideas that I found were interesting and I'm still planning on getting something written up about the event. Last night I met up with [Documentally](http://www.documentally.com/) to record an interview before going to [Cynthia Mckinney's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynthia_Mckinney) talk about [confronting the empire](http://www.confrontingtheempire.org.uk/). She talked for twenty minutes or so before giving the floor for a Q&A session at which man questions were asked. She got a standing ovation at the end of her presentation. I will find a few interesting elements and post them to this website and others shortly. [Jeff Blankfort](http://www.google.co.uk/search?hl=en&q=Jeff+Blankfort&btnG=Google+Search&meta=) was also present at the event highlighting certain moments in his career.
