Saw this [post on techcrunch](http://uk.techcrunch.com/2009/01/20/twitter-unloved-in-europe/) and the intern is not wrong. I left a comment on the blog. I also decided to leave that comment here.

> Get out of London, get out of Paris. Get to the provinces and the small towns. get into the french speaking, Lithuanian speaking, portuguese portions of twitter and the social media. Letâ€™s see whether people really are interested in twitter. As an english person of course youâ€™d be led to believe that twitter is popular. You have over 10,000 people in London alone using twitter. Now step out to Portland, Dorset and see how many twitter users are active there. Twitter is not popular outside of the microcosm yet. Just because big names like ross, branson and others are on twittter doesnâ€™t mean youâ€™ve got an active group of users. It just means people heard about twitter, created an account but then not followed it up with actual tweeting, especially not in sufficient quantity for it to be considered anything more than a fad yet. I say this as a former London twitter user now living in Switzerland where people are still rather pessimistic about twitter and itâ€™s value. Of course people have heard about it but it fails to have any relevance until the time when their friends in the physical world come and participate. The intern isnâ€™t wrong in what he/she says.
