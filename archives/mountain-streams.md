Whilst some people are perfectly happy sitting at a desk chatting to others via webcams I prefer to be out and about streaming daily life. Today was one example of what I like to do. I went up to La Dole for a walk with the n95 and streamed a few landscapes for people following me on twitter to see.    We finally got caught out by some hail and thunder but my phone survived.  I want more people to do this type of thing. Come out and have fun, stream life as it happens. Show us what's outside your living room or home office.
