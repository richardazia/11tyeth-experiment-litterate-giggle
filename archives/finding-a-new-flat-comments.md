Your right flat hunting is hard work, but there are loads of websites that flat listings so you don't have to walk around, meet estate agents...you can do all of this from the comfort of your own home! If you want to go out and come back within 20 minutes then look for flats to rent in [central london!](http://www.flatstorentlive.co.uk) Hope the above helps! :)
