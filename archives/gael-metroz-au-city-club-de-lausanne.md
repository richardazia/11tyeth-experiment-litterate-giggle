Today I met, Gael MÃ©troz, a guy who decided to travel along the trail of Nicholas Bouvier shortly after his studies. It was an opportunity to try the seesmic style of interview at [the City Club](http://derriere-le-hublot.com/cityclub/) in Lausanne. The idea is simple. Those doing the interview have a laptop with a webcam and a good internet connection. They go to film an interview with the laptop and the audience themselves ask questions from the person appearing. It was the first time that the people I was with tried this style of interview and it was a good experience. Nomad's land - Gael MÃ©troz[![](http://seesmic.com/images/spacer.gif)](http://seesmic.com) What was also a nice experience was getting to talk with Gael, getting a more personal view than if we had watched the interview on television. It's a more relaxed, and in this case, less rushed interview, more personal less formal. I hope that we get to do more of these events.
