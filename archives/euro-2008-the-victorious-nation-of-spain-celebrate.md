It's a sunday night in Switzerland and I'm with some friends. Spain were playing Germany and won 1-0, a respectable score. I was there with the phone streaming the celebrations at the Geneva Fanzone in Plainpalais. Here are the clips  Ten seconds from the end.  Spanish Fans celebrate.  Drumming atmosphere.  Happy girls dancing and the crowd.  Dancing Spanish Flag wearing people.  Because Women aren't forgotten after all.  Girls dancing, boy texting, more dancing  More dancing  Still celebrating  Leaving the Fanzone
