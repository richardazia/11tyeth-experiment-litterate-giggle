Today' I'd like to discuss stricter measures. Coop and Migros both have online shops set up for home delivery but the system is overloaded by people ordering at the same time. They don't have the truck fleet or staff to cope with the demand so I suggest a better solution.

Both Digitec and Galaxus allow people to order online and choose which shop they want to pick up their purchases. This idea is relevant today because Migros, Coop and other shops are now forcing people to queue outside shops before being allowed to go in and make their purchases.

Queuing, whilst keeping shops from getting crowded inside, will increase the risk of propagation of the virus outside the shops. People have a tendency not to stand with the minimum of two-meter distance separation. The larger the crowd the longer the queue, and the longer the wait the higher the probability of contagion.

If we could shop online and request distribution from a specific point the time we spend at the shops would be cut down to a minute or two and it would have the added benefit that we would not even need to go into the shop. I don't want to go to the shops at all if I need to queue but there is no choice.

The system they put in place yesterday will result in more, rather than less hoarding and increase the amount of time people spend in proximity to others.

Vaud has flattened. [Source](https://www.corona-data.ch/)

Having said this the graph for Vaud has flattened but I don't know whether this is because they ran out of test kits or whether they have failed to update the figures at the time when I wrote this blog post. I hope the worst is over for this Canton.
