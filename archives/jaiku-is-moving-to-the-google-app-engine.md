Jaiku is about as old as twitter but rather than expand and get two million users it was bought by google some months ago. This weekend the service has been unavailable and the reason for this is that they're moving from the old finnish server to the google App engine. [Pat](http://twitter.com/patphelan/statuses/896891823) pointed me to [this blog post](http://jaikuinvites.com/jaiku-is-now-on-the-google-app-engine/). Now all is clear. The question is how soon will it be until Jaiku is opened up for the masses to start using it? Will it be when Android comes out? Time will show us.
