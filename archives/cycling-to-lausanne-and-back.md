When I set off on my cycling trip to Lausanne and back I thought that the strong wind would force me to turn around and that I would abort the attempt by the time I got to Rolle or Morges. As I continued cycling I fought the wind and I made slow progress. When I was in the dips or along certain walls I had a break from the wind. I continued on with the effort. A nice portion of this route is on cycle paths so you are protected from traffic. Sometimes the cycle path is on the side of the road and at other points it is on a pavement at the side of the road. Near St Prex the route bifurcates from the road and goes through a 30km zone. You rejoin the road a few minutes later. Around Ouchy the roads were relatively quiet. \[caption id="attachment\_3136" align="aligncenter" width="660"\][![I stopped in Ouchy to recover ](http://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/DSC_0331-768x1024.jpg)](http://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/DSC_0331.jpg) I stopped in Ouchy to recover before cycling back.\[/caption\] The air temperature when I set off was about 20Â°c with wind. As I cycled I never felt too warm. It was a great temperature in which to cycle over a long distance. For the first hour I was drinking Jura water before switching to electrolytes for the route back. I usually carry enough water or snacks for part of the journey and when I feel the need for a rest I stop and pick up more supplies. It keeps the weight down.  I was lucky when I cycled back towards Gland because the wind continued blowing in the same direction. The wind that I had spent the outward journey fighting was now in my back. As a result despite muscle fatigue the cycle back was comfortable enough and I still managed to get a good time. The challenge when cycling from the foot of the Jura is that you eventually need to spend energy to get from the lake uphill. It might be psychological but the place from which I like to climb from the lakeside is through Gland. There are a number of routes with reduced traffic or you can take the main road. In this case I took the main road and when I was passing the train station I felt the rear wheel wobble so I stopped to check the wheel but it seemed fine. I then cycled a little further and then heard the rear tire flopping. A thorn had made its way in to the tire and punctured it. I had noticed that there was a [cycle shop](https://www.google.ch/maps/dir/''/Rue+de+Riant-Coteau+5,+1196+Gland/@46.4191264,6.2830138,18z/data=!4m8!4m7!1m0!1m5!1m1!1s0x478c43623ffd3dcd:0xd88641502ba61f1f!2m2!1d6.2833805!2d46.4194473) on the lake road so instead of going to the two sports shop near the bouldering gym I went to this one. The owner was just about to leave when he saw me pushing my bike. He was very helpful. He helped me replace the tire and pump it up again so that I could continue my journey. I had always worried about getting a puncture and I was lucky that it happened in such a convenient place. I had to walk back about two kilometres but in the end the inconvenience of the puncture was quickly resolved and I could head home. It provided me with time to recover before heading up the hill once again. I am amused that it was a thorn. I cycle around rocks, glass and other hazards on the road and nature got me with a simple thorn. To be fair I had cycled about nine hundred kilometres before getting a puncture. \[caption id="attachment\_3137" align="aligncenter" width="225"\][![Some of the landscape you see](http://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/DSC_0332-225x300.jpg)](http://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/DSC_0332.jpg) Some of the landscape you see\[/caption\]   In the back of my mind I was always ready to cycle to Lausanne and then catch the train back but my endurance lasted both ways so I skipped the train. My next challenge will be to cycle around the Lac de NeuchÃ¢tel which is meant to be about 96 kilometres depending on the route you choose.
