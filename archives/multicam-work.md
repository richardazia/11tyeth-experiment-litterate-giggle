There's a studio, three cameras, four female dancers, one male. It's a cabaret show yet no one is in costume. That's because it's a practice session for those who will be using the studio in two weeks. I don't like having a prompter on the front of the camera because it makes smooth movements harder to achieve. It doesn't matter. I'll get it right for the proper costumed event.
