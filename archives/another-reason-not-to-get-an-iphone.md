One of the great things about devices failing is when you've got other devices you depend on to keep everything synced up. In particular today I'm seeing another reason never to get an Iphone. If your computer goes down for any reason syncing between the phone and the computer is screwed up. You could, if you're not careful lose all the apps you paid for, all the music you paid for and all other data you have on the iphone/ipod touch or other device. Do you really want a device that depends on another device, especially when either one could fail? I don't. Happy not to be an iphone user :-)
