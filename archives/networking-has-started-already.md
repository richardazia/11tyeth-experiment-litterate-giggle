The stage isn't even ready at Leweb but already the networking started this evening as a few companies presented their companies and what they can do. At the same time i got to meet two London friends as well as some others. It's seesmic that invited me so there's a good chance you can find me at the seesmic stand at various moments of the day. As I'll be online from there you should see my tweets and even my seesmic videos. I know I don't seesmic much anymore but this particular week may be a little different as you might guess. If there's anything you'd like me to find out more about then let me know and we'll see what I can do to help. What I'm looking forward to is meeting the people behind the avatars whether from twitter to seesmic to a number of other platforms.
