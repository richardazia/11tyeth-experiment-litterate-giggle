According to Strava this was my 140th hike this year and my 83rd week of tracked activity. I don't know why it's only 83 weeks. My habit is older than that. When I set off, it was nice weather and warm. I didn't set off with much because I expected the walk to be short. It was eight kilometres long. Part of the reason for this is that I did the usual detour by the Huguenot route before walking towards the Jura.

Despite the threatening clouds I was not rained on. This time, rain did not start as soon as I got home. The weather is stable for now.

I have nothing else to say today, on this topic.
