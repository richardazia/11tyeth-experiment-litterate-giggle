  The Crosscall Odyssey Plus fills two niches. It is a rugged weather proof phone rated to the IP 68 standard and is equipped with dual sim capability. This makes it ideal for the sports I enjoy, mainly via ferrata as pictured below and hiking. It comes with a smaller carabiner than the one pictured below. I swapped it for one of my own. [![1030283](http://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/1030283.jpg)](http://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/1030283.jpg) [IP 68](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_Code "IP code")Â is a code to determine how resistant a device is to both particulate matter and liquids. 6 denotes that the device is dust tight so particulate matter will not make it's way in. 8 as defined by the manufacturer denotes that this device can be submerged for half an hour at 1m before damage occurs. If you get caught in the rain or have to cross a river the phone should survive. Another interesting feature is the dual sim capability. This phone allows for two microsims to be used at once. In my case I have a Swiss sim card and a french one. Both sims are constantly active so you can select whether to make phone calls from Sim 1 or Sim 2. You can also select which sim card is using the data plan. It runs android 4.3 and works fine with the TomTom app, the ingress and others. I found that battery life is also comfortable. With me as a user the battery lasts for a day. [more info](http://crosscall.com/boutique/fr/smartphones/37-smartphone-etanche-resistant-3700764700426.html "More info")
