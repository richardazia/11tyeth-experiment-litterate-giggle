For several days I have not been looking as seriously at the COVID-19 case graphs for Switzerland because we the storm waves of new cases that we were getting before are now no more than ripples on a pond. The situation seems to be under control in Switzerland.

A graph of the daily new cases - we see a consistent degradation of the wave.

As we look at the graph above we see that for at least a month the number of new cases was high every day but that by the fifteenth of April the number of cases decreased week, by week, until the number of new cases per day seems imperceptible at the scale of the graph above.

The graph for Switzerland has flattened.

The graph for the total number of cases has flattened for a few days now so we may be over the worst. I still wear a mask in the shops and I still respect the minimum two meter distance between individuals. I don't want to lose a habit only to find I will need to resume it in a few days.

We have gone from a peak of around 14313 active cases in a day to less than 600 yesterday.

The number of active cases has also gone down. We are now at around six hundred active cases.

Cars waiting to cross into France

During one of my many walks I passed by the French border from Vaud into Divonne and I saw columns of cars waiting to get into France. I saw one or two cars, turn around, in the hope of finding a less congested route. For people who have to cross borders on a daily basis patience will be even more important than usual.

A discarded face mask.

Someone shared an image of two mice resting in hammocks with a caption to the effect that "it's wonderful going into cities at the moment, there are plenty of hammocks to be found.". The perspective is amusing.

Face mask as Political Statement headlines

When I went to the shops yesterday I saw that some people were wearing face masks, as was I. Now that I have a few I can wear them when I have to be indoors with other people or within close proximity to others. My only reason for not wearing a face mask was that I couldn't find them. It was never a political statement.

For some people, the wearing of a mask is a sign of oppression and of submission. For others it is common sense to wear a face mask.

The Daily Walks
---------------

Yesterday the daily walk was a run and a walk. I went on a shorter route than usual because we're at the end of the month and I had reached the daily distance goal for the day. I still walked fifteen thousand steps.

During a bike ride two days ago it was funny to see how a walking path had been worn between Signy and Eysins. So many people have walked along the grass by the road that they have left a walking path. Usually foot traffic is not heavy enough to leave a trace.

Daily Tasks
-----------

I have renamed one of my daily tasks from "write a blog post" to "work on the website". Yesterday and the day before I spent hours working on my website so I was out of creativity when it came time to write a blog post. That little change means that I'm on a 70 day streak.
