There are two things to write about. The first of these is that I recently tested the new mobile web version of the TFL website and it's really good. It's got a great user interface for a web based service and i think I'll be using it from time to time when it's needed. The second bit of info is that I'm moving into a house with 15 megabits per second web connection. I hope that the antenna is powerful to get up to my bedroom. It's not hard to test anyway. It's a top floor bedroom in zone two of the tube which means it's cheaper to get around compared to living in zone four. There are quite a few shops close by although I need to scout the area properly beforehand. I may rent a car to move the stuff since it's easier than doing three or four trips on the tube. Flat hunting was fun from the point of view that you can choose precisely where you live but in the long run it's frustrating due to the fast rate of release and take up of flats in a city with over seven million people. Film students got to the end of an essay last night therefore quite a few were at the SU bar. I didn't spend much time chatting with them but rather with some other friends. The night was particularly good and relaxed. There is one key reason for this. Summer's here.
