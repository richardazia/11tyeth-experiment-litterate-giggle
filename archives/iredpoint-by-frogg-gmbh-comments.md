Hey Richard! Thanks a lot for using my app, and thanks for the great feedback, I definitely appreciate that. The upcoming update of iRedpoint has a big improvement for the top rope tracking algorithm, I hope you'll like it. Also the ability to switch the climbing activity type during a session makes a lot of sense to me; I put it on my todo list! â€” frederik
