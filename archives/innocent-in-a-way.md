[Innocent, in a way.](http://vimeo.com/32969040) from [alexis wanneroy](http://vimeo.com/alexiswanneroy) on [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com).

Documentaries are sometimes invitations in to someone else's life. The subject of the documentary trusts the person who is filming, to paint them in a positive light. In this case the topic may be seen as controversial in some countries and perfectly normal in others. As viewers we take a break from the realities we live in to experience that of others. As an aside watch this documentary and you will see that it is relaxed, the music is relaxed, the setting is convivial. There are no computer graphics, no sensationalism. It's just moments in life. Life unawares and voyeurism are important. Remember that conversation between the two directors of Chronique D'un Ã©tÃ©? You get to the end of the film, after the screening and the commentary an you hear "Some people thought that she was too honest" and others say "That person wasn't honest enough.". Our reservations act as filters to our ability to enjoy or experience what we see on the screen. This is part of the reason for watching independent films rather than commercial films.
