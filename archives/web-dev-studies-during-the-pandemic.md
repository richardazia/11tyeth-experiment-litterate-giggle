During this Pandemic, I have decided to study Web Development and I am slowly making my way through one or two Linkedin Learning Pathways. In the process, I have learned about CSS, PHP, JavaScript ECMAScript2016, Frameworks and more.

The course I have studied are:

Angular Essential Training / React.js Essential Training / Git Essential Training / Learning ECMAScript 6 /Node.js Essential Training / Javascript Essential Training / RubyonRails Essential Training / CSS Essential Training / Ruby Essential Training : 1 The Basics / Installing and Running Ruby On Rails 5: Mac / Programming Foundations: Web Security /PHP with MySQL / Essential Training 1 and 2 /PHP Essential Training / Programming Foundations: Databases / Responsive Layout / HTML Essential Training / Introduction to CSS and CSS Essential Training.

With these studies I am getting a good overall appreciation of the options and solutions available to web developers. When I complete the "Become A full-Stack Developer and Become a Web Developer Courses I want to focus on a single framework and try to do everything from scratch, from setup to deployment, or at least to it being "completed".

It's easy to watch hours of videos and not learn much. It's for that reason that with these courses I have re-written every line of code and when it did not work I persisted until I resolved the issues.

With CSS I took the opportunity to re-work the entire website. I made it mobile compliant and more visually appealing. I plan to take the same approach to learn about frameworks, taking my website and its sections, and using a framework as a CMS.

For now I need to keep progressing with the learning pathway. I have eighteen hours of courses to go but that's without including the hours of effort put into getting things to work after I've written the lines of code.

At least this is a productive way of taking advantage of being in self-isolation for the foreseeable future.
