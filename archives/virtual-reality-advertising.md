At this moment in time Virtual Reality is an abstract notion for most people. It is easy to find news features and documentaries speaking about the potential of the medium. The video above is the most effective demonstration of Virtual Reality that I have seen so far. I like that they use a greenscreen to key in the environment that the guinea pigs are in. We are immersed in to the reality that they are seeing. It demonstrates not only the games and environments you could find yourself in but how it is a communal rather than solitary experience. This advert removes some of the stigma of virtual reality. From the 6th of May to the 8th of May 2016 a meeting will take place in Crans Montana Switzerland. It has the title of [World Virtual Reality Forum](http://worldvrforum.com/). Â "The World VR Forum isÂ dedicated to advancing the virtual reality industry and culture." Artists, documentary makers, news producers, architects, surgeons and an ever-expanding group of people will benefit from this technology. The video above helps us understand the intricacies of using something as simple as two hand held controllers. In two to three months the Music festival season will start with Caribana, Montreux Jazz, PalÃ©o Festival and many other music festivals. During these events media outlets and artists love to give interviews to journalists to drive interest in their upcoming performance. For now we usually have two or more cameras. In some cases you have one wide shot of the room or the artists and the second camera is a close up of the artist as he speaks. This summer I expect that we will watch interviews in 360Â° video where we can turn and see the journalist asking questions and turn to face the artist when he answers. When a group of artists are interviewed you will be able to watch the antics whilst listening to what they are saying. You will watch the artists and the journalists smile and laugh. When I think of VR goggles I do not think so much about gaming as I think about documentary and television production. I like to think about how it could provide new opportunities for content producers to create interesting and immersive video content. "Their headsets were connected with the school campus more than 900 miles away in Okinawa, where the schoolâ€™s headmaster spoke. The students were also treated to a 360 degree view of the campus inside the augmented reality." ([source](http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2016/04/07/online-high-school-in-japan-enters-virtual-reality/)) Google Streetview could provide live 360Â° vision of specific squares, St Marco in Venice, Notre Dame in Paris, St Peter's in Rome or the market Square in Wroclaw. Imagine Google Street view when wearing a VR headset. VR headsets are being offered by a number of brands for all mobile phones and the number of cameras able to provide 360Â° video are growing in number. As both of these democratise the market so content creators will have more customers and more incentive to produce relevant content.
