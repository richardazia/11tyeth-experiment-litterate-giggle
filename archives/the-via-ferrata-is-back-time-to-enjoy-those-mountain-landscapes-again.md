I will be in the mountains every second weekend from now on to explore via ferratas and hike. The next via ferrata I will explore is the [Via Ferrata Lavanchy](https://sites.google.com/site/topoviaferratatrailsuisse2/lavanchy). From what I read this is an easy and short Via Ferrata (VF). We will see if it would be a good place for beginners to try this enjoyable sport.
