Sometimes you go for a walk and you see sunflowers and bees. The bees love the sunflowers and sometimes the volume of bees is so great that you can hear a swarm, or even many swarms of them. Each one picks up a little nectar before moving on to the next.

I donâ€™t know whether they have a honey made just from sunflowers, like they do from lavender or other plants.
