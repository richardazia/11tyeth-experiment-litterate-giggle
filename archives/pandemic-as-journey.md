Although not discussed as such the pandemic is an interior journey in the same manner as thru hikes as they are called in the US and pilgrimages in Europe. We start with one identity and one life and we have to adapt it to suit the things that can be realised during a pandemic.

We are in solitude with our thoughts so we need to work on our inner character, ready to resume post pandemic life, once that opportunity comes back. Whenever that may be.
