If that's true then my MBP is waiting for me in Switzerland but I'm stuck in London for another week before i can go back and get it. Tonight I'll find out whether a note was left by the delivery company and soon I'll start up the computer for the first time. I'm looking forward to that. Once it's home it's home and the suspense is no longer there.
