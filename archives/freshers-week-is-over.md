Fresher's week is over and lessons start this week. It means being serious a little more of the time than over the past week. I've been patrolling the flats already, going from room to room and seeing lots of people, lots of new faces.Â  This is an easy and a hard job. It's easy because it involves little more than walking and chatting with people. It's hard because occasionally you're patrolling until the sun rises. you need to go to kitchens and halls to make sure that people are not too loud. Occasionally they're open to this idea. Tuesday I have my first lessons and that's going to be interesting, seeing how much extra work there will be from this time onwards.
