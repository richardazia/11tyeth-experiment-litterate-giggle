Plenty of yellow, some purple and other types of flowers in a field nearby

The pandemic continues. People continue suggesting to do things in the physical world but I find little to no desire to be in close proximity to others, The only moment I am, is when I am cycling.

Today I didn't bother wearing a mask to recycle, not because I didn't have it with me but because there were no people around. This proves that when the pandemic is over and that risks are minimal, I will resume normal life, without a mask at all times.

I can keep dreaming of that day.
