I always go to social media events and meet a lot of geeks who love to use new technology such as twitter, seesmic and more. For once it's a little different. I'm in Fribourg where I'm surrounded by writers. There are a lot of PC rather than Mac computers. The hot chocolate is good and the city is nice.

The concept is simple. Write solidly for five minutes at a time and see who has the highest word count. So far I've written 313 and then 328 in two sessions, not bad. Word count is now over 24,000 words.
