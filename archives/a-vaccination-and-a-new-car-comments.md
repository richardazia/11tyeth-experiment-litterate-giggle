I was in line outside at a boulangerie last week and a guy behind me would not step back. Yes, we had masks on, and yes, we were outside, but even not in pandemic times, he was too dang close for my comfort. No point saying anything--I didn't see the point in getting into a shouting match in the street with a stranger. Getting my second dose on the 31st. Beyond ready.

My safety habit is to avoid being in towns or villages, and I stay away from crowds. It isn't easy, but I found new walking routes.
