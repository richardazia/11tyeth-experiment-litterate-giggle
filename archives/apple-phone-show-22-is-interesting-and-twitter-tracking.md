[Apple Phone Show no. 22](http://applephoneshow.com/index.php/archives/938) is a particularly good episode. [Andy Ihnatko](http://www.cwob.com/) and Scott Bourne discuss how to use the iPhone in real-life situations. It's a precursor of things to come in the near future. I've decided to try Twitter tracking which works by you selecting which words you want to follow. The messages are then sent straight to your phone and you follow any conversations on the topic.
