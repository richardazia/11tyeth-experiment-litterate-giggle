After over a month without the macbook pro it finally appears to be working again. Both the motherboard and the superdrive have been replaced. i've upgraded to the procare package and I've decided to have a secondary machine running linux as a backup.Â  It's a shame that apple authorised resellers would take over a month to put my machine right bt now it's done and I'm not going to think about upgrading mac machines for the next two years... unless I come to a large amount of cash in which case I'd rethink that.Â  What I am more interested in now though is what can be done with mobile phones and mobile devices. In particular I was really happy to have the N95 8gig because it allowed me to cut out the laptop all together.Â  The point is that now all devices should be self contained, able to do everything without the need for a laptop. For weeks I couldn't get the latest podcasts or keep up with feedreading. Even checking e-mail was less practical. Now is the time to see how far we can go in doing everything from a portable device.Â
