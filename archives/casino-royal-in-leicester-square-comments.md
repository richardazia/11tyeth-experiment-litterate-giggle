Hi everyone, Hi Richard. I am actually the friend Richard was talking about in his previous message, the one who had the honour to shake the hand of the great actor Daniel Craig. My name's Emanuele, nice to meet you all. Tonight was a great evening, we had lots of fun, especially watching and taking pictures of many celebrities walking on the red carpet. We even managed to take for us two of the posters which are usually put on the reel during any movie premiere. That was smply great!
