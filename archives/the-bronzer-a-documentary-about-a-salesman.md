Documentaries are often about finding the right person. The right person is a person who is passionate about what he or she does. The person talks about their field in a number of locations and the documentary films what is going on in a number of locations. The point is that story telling by the talent is important but the visual story is also important. This is a visual medium. Show us. If all we want to do is listen then we have access to radio content and podcasts.
