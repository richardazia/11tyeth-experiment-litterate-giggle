La Tour D'ai in Switzerland is a great opportunity to look across to the Canton de Vaud and the Lac LÃ©man. From here you can look at several canton. The via ferrata has a nice little walk to the base. At this point you start the climbing. It's an easy aerial via ferrata. \[flickr-gallery mode="photoset" photoset="72157627299831715"\]
