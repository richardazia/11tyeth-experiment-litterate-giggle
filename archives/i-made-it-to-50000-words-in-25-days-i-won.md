That's it. I've made it. I wrote 50,000 words in 25 days, That's an average of 2000 words a day for 25 days. That's a lot of writing. That's a lot of re-writing. It was fun meeting some of these writers over the past two weeks and I look forward to at least one or two more meetups. In the meantime I'm one of those that have completed the task. Let's see how many others have achieved the goal.
