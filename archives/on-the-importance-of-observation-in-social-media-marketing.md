> However, many purported Social Media experts are merely engaging in cultural voyeurism at best. They look from afar and roam the perimeters of online societies without ever becoming a true member of any society. This means, they donâ€™t truly understand what, where, or why theyâ€™re â€œparticipating,â€ only jumping in because they have something to say and have access to the tools that will carry it into play. This is unfortunately a representation of the greater landscape of Social Media Marketing and itâ€™s time to take a step back and study the sociology of Social Media in order to keep communities intact and unaffected by outsiders.

> Social Media is much more than user-generated content. Itâ€™s driven by people in the communities where they communicate and congregate. They create, share, and discover new content without our help right now. Theyâ€™re creating online cultures across online networks and using the Social Tools that we learn about each and every day to stay connected. And the societies that host and facilitate these conversations cultivate a tight, unswerving and mostly unforgiving community and culture.
