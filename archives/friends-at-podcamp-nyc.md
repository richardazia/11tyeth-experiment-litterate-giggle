Looking through the feedreader today I spotted two friends, [Phil Campell](http://me.dm/) and [Chrisian Payne](http://ourmaninside.com/) [here](http://www.chrisbrogan.com/some-differences-between-pitching-mainstream-press-and-bloggers/)

Maybe in a year or two I can travel to a number of these events and enjoy a little more travel once again.
