Every single day I see posts about how facebook, twitter and social media are a waste of time. I read every day about how they distract us and prevent us from making progress in our professional lives. I would like to argue that, used properly, social networks (encompassed within social media) are a great way to connect with people. London is a great place for social media to be used as a networking tool. Due to the number of young professionals user density is at critical mass. Invest enough time online and you will find people to meet in person. Twitter can help you meet new people, Facebook provides you with a place to talk with familiar people and Google+ provides you with a space in which to discuss topics by themes with non-work related people. Linkedin is a place to follow the professional life of your contacts. Conferences are social networks. TEDx talks, unconferences, conferences, General Staff Meetings and events such as LIFT are non-stigmatised social networks. At these events you are expected to converse, to meet new people and of course to discuss a number of themes with people from different social and professional backgrounds.
