The advantage of being a 25-year-old student is the following. You've been insulted, you've been threatened, you've been in trouble, you've shown that you're an honourable person and more. Tonight there was a party in my flat and I asked for the mess to be cleaned up and it has been. For such a request I've been labeled a fucking prick. If only it were true. That's part of life. You make demands and get abuse for the demands. I've had my door bangedÂ  on at least twice in the past half hour to an hour but frankly, I don't care. I'm not going to lodge a complaint. I just want responsibility for parties to sink through. Anyway, goodnight, and see you tomorrow.
