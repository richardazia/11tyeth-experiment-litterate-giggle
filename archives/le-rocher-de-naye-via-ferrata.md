the Rocher de Naye via ferrata is a fun via ferrata which takes about 1hr and a half to complete. I went today with some glocals friends. It went well and everyone got to the top. I did not take the difficult stretch this time. I will do it in full in a few weeks. What is interesting about this via ferrata is that there are more technical bits. You need to reach at moments, find higher footholds to progress. You also have a healthy dose of heights to contend with. \[flickr-gallery mode="photoset" photoset="72157627477641368"\]
