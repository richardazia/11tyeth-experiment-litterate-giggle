For the first time in my life I am cat sitting. I’m used to village cats and this is a city cat so I don’t know how much time I need to spend with the cat, how much I need to play and more.

When I look after toddlers I know that I have to be attentive to them from the moment they wake up to the moment they nap or sleep. It's a challenge to have that level of endurance.

I've started the first 24hr day of looking after a cat and so far it seems that I'm more attentive than I need to be. I feel like I should keep the window open and keep the cat entertained but this is a cat we're talking about. They entertain themselves.

If we were in the middle of summer I would go for three to five-hour rides taking advantage of the new starting and endpoint. As we're in the middle of winter I'm waiting for a film festival to start. As soon as it starts I will have something to do in Geneva. For now, I've been walking around and playing Ingress.

It's nice to be so close to the centre of Geneva. I can walk everywhere within half an hour to an hour. Geneva is a small city when you know it. There is no need for buses, trams, taxis etc. Usually, something like going to the Apple store would be an expedition because it takes a 20-minute walk, a train, and then another 20-minute walk. Today I could do the walk within 20 minutes.

We will see how my impressions change over the coming days.
