I'm not the only person that's annoyed with the vast amount of downtime suffered by twitter and there is a call for an international boycott of twitter on may 21st. During that day we'll be using other more reliable services to show that twitter is nothing without the community that makes it what it is. _Twitter has been having some serious issues over the last few weeks. It seems that the service is down almost as much as itâ€™s active. Exaggeration or not, itâ€™s a problem, and it seems to be worsening rather than improving. As a result, a bunch of us Twitter power users were using FriendFeed to discuss a way to hit Twitter where it hurts in order to send a message to the powers that be._ [Sourc](http://jerseysuburbia.com/?p=30)
