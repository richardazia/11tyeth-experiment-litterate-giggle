A road between green trees.

When the weather is good and there is no wind it makes sense to go for a bike ride. The roads were quiet for the most part but a few cars still passed too close and too fast. The challenge is to find the quietest, least dangerous route.

I am still looking for a route where I never feel in danger. For now I find routes where I am comfortable, for the most part.
