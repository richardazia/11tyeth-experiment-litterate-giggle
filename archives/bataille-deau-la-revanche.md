Today I went to Lausanne for a flashmob waterfight and I enjoyed it. I also got a little wet as you can tell from the second or third video. It was great fun.  Part 1  Part 2  Part 3 I love it, whilst all the photographers were standing on the sidelines I was right in the middle of the crowd watching as everyone got splashed. I got soaked quite a few times but it's really fun. Everyone should be in a flashmob water fight at least three or four times in their life, if not more. It's the third of a series of waterfights. The first two events took place earlier in summer by the lakeside both in Lausanne and Geneva.
