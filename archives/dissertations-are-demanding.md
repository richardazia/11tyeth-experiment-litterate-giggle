Spending almost all of the time when you're awake to complete your dissertation is hard, especially when you slept no more than six hours after a good night out. I've spent almost all the time I've been awake working on my dissertation and it's progressing well but there is still work to be done and although sometimes I feel good at other moments I feel like it's never going to be completed. That's a good sign. By this I mean that I'm going through all this pain and stress, wanting for it to be finished but as it's written it's a matter or re-organizing and elaborating on certain points rather than typing the whole document. I've got the time and resources to add graphics, tables, write the bibliography, and more by the deadline. I've still got more than a week but I'm pushing myself to get as much done now rather than later. When discussing the dissertation with a number of people they seemed to find the topic interesting therefore I hope that when it is finished and people get an opportunity to read if they enjoy the process. Long live the handing in of the dissertation when I shall burst into laughter from the relief I will feel.
