The High Tech world is not making us weak and weird. I believe that the opposite is true. According to Patrick Mustain in his article "[Welcome to the Devolution: The High-Tech World Is Making Us Weak and Weird](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/04/23/welcome-to-the-devolution-the-high-tech-world-is-making-us-weak-and-weird.html)" for The Daily Beast he worries that modern technology and conveniences have taken the physical aspects out of our daily routine. We don't need to clean clothes by beating them against a rock and we no longer need to clean dishes manually. We take the car from point A to point B and we take a lift to go up a floor or two.

> â€œWe find ourselves interacting with chairs and doors and walkways, and as a result, we get used to bending only forwards. Almost never backwards, never to the side, we donâ€™t really rotate our hips very much.

This premise is false. This article ignores that there are a growing amount of climbing and bouldering gyms. This article ignores that there are an increasing number of via ferratas being built and that crossfit gyms are common. "But our evolutionary drive for acquiring cheap energy also makes us loath to unnecessarily spend it." is a fallacy. Look at Strava, Sports Tracker, Movescount, Runkeeper, fitbit, Withings and other products. Each one of these not only tracks the effort that people are making on a weekly basis but congregates that data so that people can compare their workout to that of others. This implies that technology is encouraging people to move, to compete with friends, family or other sports enthusiasts. \[caption id="attachment\_2848" align="aligncenter" width="240"\][![strava stats 2016](http://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-25-at-10.09.00-240x300.png)](http://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-25-at-10.09.00.png) Strava stats so far for this year\[/caption\] There is some humour in the article. "I think any change in the direction of just moving more is better. You donâ€™t have to take off your shirt and go climb a tree to get value." It is not simply about moving more but about moving more energetically, more enthusiastically. If you're walking down the street increase your stride length just a little and you will increase your heart rate and energy expenditure. When I walk up to the base of the Val De TiÃ¨re via ferrata and when I walk up to the base of the Tour D'AÃ¯ via ferrata I am usually the first one, leading the way.Â I love endurance training so I forget about the group and I enjoy the hike. Once I am at the base I relax, I look at the landscape and I take photographs. As a camera operator/photographer I need to be at least as fit as everyone else and if possible I need to have more energy. By having more energy I can go ahead of the group and document their effort as they make their way up or down a mountain. Since I owned the Nokia N95 8GB model I have tracked more than a thousand sports activities. I have tracked skiing, snowboarding, snowshoeing, hiking, cycling, climbing, via ferrata, indoor training, sailing and swimming.Â It is thanks to the high tech world that I can track my progress and assess how well I am doing. It allows me to set goals and exceed them and it allows me to evaluate when to take breaks and when to continue pushing forwards. I love technology but I still walked up five floors to get to my office. I almost never sit in public transport and I usually take the stairs or walk up escalators rather than stand around. Movement is an integral part of my daily routine so I do not accept the premise that high tech world makes us weak and weird.
