The Friend density map is an interesting one. It shows you where the highest concentration of your friends is. It's a good idea when you've got friends spread around the world as we do. It's a shame it's limited only to the US at the moment. I can only see six percent of my friends this way.

I sent a quick message to the creator of the API and I hope he resolves this issue in the near future.
