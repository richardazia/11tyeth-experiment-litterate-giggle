[![Port de Nyon](http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2652/4237190346_05c36e8676.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/mainvision/4237190346/ "Port de Nyon") Port of Nyon in Winter The picture above was done with an iphone and theÂ [autostitch](http://people.cs.ubc.ca/~mbrown/autostitch/autostitch.html) application. To produce this type of photograph the process is simple. You take a series of pictures with the Iphone camera before going to the autostitch application. You select the photographs that you want stitched together and click the stitch button. The application will then find objects within the photograph before combining them into one panoramic shot. Once the image is processed you have the option of either saving the picture as it is or cropping it to remove the edges hence giving this type of result.
