Within the last week Honeypot Originals have released a number of documentaries. Each episode covers a different JavaScript Framework. So far that have Vue.js, Ember.js, Elixir and GraphQL. Each of these documentaries is about half an hour long and interviews some of the key players. What is nice about these documentaries is that they take names and projects that may be familiar to us, but add faces and context to them. I have heard about some of these people via podcasts and more. With these videos I get to listen to them, and watch them explain the importance of their projects.

After watching these videos you may get a better understanding of why you would, or would not want to study a specific language. It takes a project from just being a name in the title of a video to something less abstract.

The video about Vue.js cleared some of my hesitancy about studying the framework. Hearing about how the Laravel and other communities grew to be interested in the framework is interesting. It seems like a worthwhile alternative to React and Angular, the two giants in the space.

When I watched the video about GraphQL I didn't really get the answer about why I should choose it over JSON. So far the answer seems to be "because it only returns the data you want to use. I will need to spend time trying to understand what its key selling point is.

I wanted to take a break from the usual studying habit today, to have a rest day whilst still moving forward.

I am now fourty percent through a Udemy Course to master javascript and I am struggling more, now, than before. It isn't easy to master such a complex subject. I should practice more, from outside of the course. I thought strings would be simple but there are details that I need to explore further.

That's it for today.
