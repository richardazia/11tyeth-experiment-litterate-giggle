There are two communities on Seesmic, those that are English speakers and those that are French speakers. The French speaking seesmicers can be recognized by two things. The first one is the Racoon avatar, the second is that they refer to each other as the Francofous, the crazy french. Last night [Seesmic](http://www.seesmic.com) went down due to an upgrade gone wrong and as a result many seesmicers didn't know what to do with their time. One seesmicer decided to create a skype conference call where over ten seesmicers were chatting for quite a few hours. I only found out about it via the discussion between [Fred2baro](http://twitter.com/fred2baro) and [Sizemore](http://twitter.com/sizemore) and added Fred2baro. Quite a few of the French seesmicers were there and we discussed many topics and it lasted for at least three hours before it was cut short. What made this conversation so interesting is how people came in and left at various points and how at one point [Eric Rice](http://twitter.com/spin) and [Purplecar](http://twitter.com/purplecar) joined the conversation. A few more people joined in including [Loic Lemeur](http://twitter.com/loiclemeur) although his presence was short due to children in the background playing on a PSP. I think that this is what the future of web interactions is about. It's about a global community of people, at the moment early adopters, who have strong ties with friends and family in various parts of the world and no particular illustrated that such as the one of [Kosso](http://twitter.com/kosso) and [Ifiz](http://twitter.com/01000101). They like to advertise that they met "in 140 characters or less". That was a nice story and it shows the point of the new age of social interactions. I won't give all the details here as you can easily ask them in person at a later date.
