My shoes are wet and my socks are wet because today I tried river walking. If a child was to do the same it would be called immature and irrational but when an adult does it then it's adventure, and trying something new.

My motivation to river walk came from the pandemic, or more precisely from how people behave during a pandemic. When I walked yesterday I had a runner pass right by me and then spit on the ground a few meters ahead of where I would have been going. When I walked through the woods yesterday I could hear groups of people so I avoided walking along the same routes.

That's why I placed both feet, and the shoes they were in, into the river and walked. I didn't get that far. In fact I was only able to walk a few dozen meters before finding that the river would have required wading. I wasn't prepared to do that. We're not in a heatwave yet.

Channels are dug into the rocks

Although you can't really see it in the image above grooves have been worn into the rock strata. As a result you shouldn't spend all of your time looking forward because you'll be caught out. River walking requires you to look at where you're placing your feet. In the image below you can see these erosion patterns more clearly.

Grooves in the rock

I've walked along the routes so much that now I'm starting to get to know the details. Now I know that the river is beautiful and that if you're willing to get wet you can see some nice features. There are a few places I need to return to, and document through photography.

This morning I was looking through to see if Thru-hiking had started and to see whether people would still try to thru hike any of the main trails in the US and from what I see most people have not started and those that did have postponed their hikes for now.

As a follow up to this I listened to [this episode](https://www.hiking-thru.com/episodes/chris-smead) of the [Hiking Thru](https://www.hiking-thru.com/about) podcast. It's about Chris Smead going for a lesser known Thru hike with eleven lenses, seventy five batteries and a monopod to document a hike with a group of people. The hike sounds like an interesting experience. It also makes a nice change from listening to so many news and current affairs programs. A moment to dream.

I will keep exploring. To a large degree I treated today as if there was no pandemic and that was refreshing. I still washed my hands as soon as I got home. I just didn't stay cooped up indoors without treating myself. Exploration is a treat.
