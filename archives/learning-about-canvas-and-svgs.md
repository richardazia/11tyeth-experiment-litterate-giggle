Other the last week I have been learning about canvas and SVGs. I am not certain that I will use this knowledge immediately but it is good to learn nonetheless.

I struggled with some code when setting up a clock. I went back through the code line by line two or three times before trying to find a version in written form. I did and went through each line yet again. Eventually I found that I was missing one zero. I added it. Saved it, refreshed and then loaded the page again and it worked. I studied for almost two hours today.

Pandemic
--------

Omicron is going to sweep through populations but instead of wearing masks, self isolating and avoiding large groups people will do the opposite and then blame governments for their lack of understanding about the pandemic.

For a year and a half it has been self isolate, wear a mask, social distance and more. The winning strategies not to fall sick have remained the same and yet people pretend to be clueless. The result is a pandemic wave sweeping through Europe and the US over the coming month.

Life continues. We just adapt to being satisfied with what is safe.
