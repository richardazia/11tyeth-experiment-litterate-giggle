Instagram is still a healthy social network. It still finds an engaged group of users who want to share their adventures, meals, friendships and more with other users. Some of them love sharing selfies and others share beautiful landscapes. This keeps the network vibrant and young. Twitter on the other hand has neutralised peoples' passion and engagement with the site. They wanted to become google reader, they wanted mass following of key accounts, they wanted to neutralise the social, conversational aspect and they have succeeded in their goal so effectively that now an IFTTT rule reduces the need to visit twitter. \[caption id="attachment\_2980" align="aligncenter" width="660"\][![IFTTT Instagram twitter](http://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Screen-Shot-2016-06-22-at-09.34.26-1024x581.png)](http://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Screen-Shot-2016-06-22-at-09.34.26.png) Which network do you prioritise\[/caption\] When you share your instagram photos as native twitter photos you are hiding that you are disengaged from Twitter. By hiding this disengagement from the social network you are hiding that you may not respond to replies, mentions etc. By not responding to those interactions you are negating the purpose of your presence on the social network. \[caption id="attachment\_2979" align="aligncenter" width="660"\][![Twitter declines further](http://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Screen-Shot-2016-06-22-at-09.31.26-1024x534.png)](http://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Screen-Shot-2016-06-22-at-09.31.26.png) The once social network Twitter continues to decline\[/caption\] When you fail to interact directly with websites such as Twitter you perpetuate the notion that twitter is a place where bots interact with bots because humans are no longer present. When humans are gone, when interactions between users no longer take place then what remains of the "social network"? Two hundred and ninety six thousand people have added this recipe to their IFTTT accounts. A quarter of a million peopleÂ have chosen to spend time on Instagram rather than twitter. For this reason it makes sense to share pictures via Instagram. We will see your instagram account and we can start following it. In so doing we spend our time more effectively. Instagram still has a future. If you post to the networks that you want to use there is a good opportunity that others will want the same. Lets cut out twitter. ;-)
