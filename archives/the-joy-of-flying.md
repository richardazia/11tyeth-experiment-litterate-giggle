I've flown geneva to London so many times that I'm completely indifferent about the flight. I'm not so indifferent about the consistent flight delays that I always get. At the moment today's delay is nothing but one hr fourty. That's a delay that lasts longer than the flight. I wish flying was like catching the tube. Tap in, get on, tap out, get off and done. ![wifi in Luton](http://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/luton-wifi.jpg) (stats for Luton Airport wifi) They should provide free wifi in airports so that we are fooled into thinkng we're not in a boring airport. There's nothing in London luton to do. Ah well. at least I have two ipods, two phones, one laptop and work to cover the flight.
