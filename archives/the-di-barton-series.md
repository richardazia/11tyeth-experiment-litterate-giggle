Recently I have read three out of four [DI Barton books](https://www.goodreads.com/series/273771-di-barton) and I enjoy them. One of the things that I enjoyed about these books is that I'm interested in both sides of the story, rather than reading about character A but being frustrated when reading about character B. With these books I like both.

The first book is about a seasonal killer, and it moves on from there. I could give more information but I don't want to spoil the books for you. These books are available via Audible's Premium plus package, for the first three books, and you need to spend one credit per book for the last three books.

I don't like writing book reviews. I think that the speed with which I read books tells you whether these books are good or not. I read the first three within two or three weeks and I enjoyed them all, hence the purchase of the fourth. The books are presented from the DI's perspective and the serial killer's point of view in turn. As you read you learn more, until the final d√©nouement.

We should spend more time listening to audiobooks and discussing them. It is easy to find articles and news about films and more, but less so about audible.com among other projects. We could see every book as a series, especially since they last about seven hours. I like reading books with my eyes but I also enjoy listening, whilst walking, driving etc.

Long drives are one of the most enjoyable moments for listening to audiobooks. As you read them you imagine the stories you're reading, but you also associate one book with a bit of motorway, or a season. I used to enjoy listening to podcasts but I think that with their minutes of adverts per episode they have become too much like the television shows and radio programs we got into the habit of avoiding.

With audiobooks there are no adverts, just stories that help you stay focused on long drives, especially if you're driving alone. Don't be tricked. Most of my reading is done either while cooking or while walking. With books a solitary walk becomes an excuse to "read", uninterrupted, for a period of time.
