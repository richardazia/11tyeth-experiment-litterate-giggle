I'm on the second floor of a home which looks out onto a busy road which means there's a lot of traffic passing by but wait there's more. Road works are taking place. Traffic must stop. Stopped traffic means hours of entertainment from the comfort of your room.

So far I saw one van back into the car that was sticking to the back. The guy got out and started to yell whilst another was less annoyed. In a second case I saw one-car crash into the back of the second and this was amusing. The guy who crashed was relaxed, almost joking whilst the over was really angry, as most people would be. Two cars were behind this crash and they grew impatient, started beeping, and more. The guy who was crashed into started yelling abuse at them as they drove away.

In other cases you see the large trucks trying to negotiate the bend and that's impressive. You see some people struggling to park a fiat 500. They find it easy to move their truck although it takes wide turns and some back and forth.

Today I watched out of the window as one of these large trucks was waiting for the road to be clear so that it could negotiate this bend yet no one was courteous enough to wait. They could have and the road would be easier to negotiate for all to use.

There is one thing that annoys me more than anything else with traffic outside a window. People beeping. If you've ever lived roadside you know the sound. One person forgets to pay attention to the light and someone behind decides to beep. As a result everyone in the area hears this. It's annoying because simply flashing your headlights at the person in front is enough to get them to continue on their absent-minded way. This is not a value judgment. They weren't paying attention to the light therefore my remark is justified ;).

Now the last element, loud music s sometimes nice and other times not quite. I've never heard someone drive through a city with the BBC world service blaring out of their speakers. I'd find that interesting and intriguing at the same time. Most of the time its hip hop, R&B, and such. That's just part of life.

Skidding tires are another amusing feature. You know how it goes. You're in your car and you've been driving it so much your clutch control is fast, almost perfect. Sometimes though your foot presses on the accelerator just a little too hard and your tires lose traction causing a nice little screech and the sound of slipping tires as you attempt to move off. I watched as someone in a delivery truck did that. What surprised me is that he just let the tires screech until they got traction rather than let go of the throttle and move off normally.

All this to say that aside from wanting to throw water balloons through the car window at the idiot beeping traffic doesn't bother me.
