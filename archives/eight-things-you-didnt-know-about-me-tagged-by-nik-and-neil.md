Both [Nik](http://www.loudmouthman.com/2008/03/06/eight-things-which-dont-make-sense/) and [Neil](http://dungeekin.blogspot.com/) have tagged me to talk about **eight random things about myself** and since I have some time tonight I'll work on this. 1) I reached competition level as a skier in France after progressing through all the levels but have never bothered to compete. I love the sport and the sensations rather than comparing myself to others. It's a year after I reached competition level that I moved on to learning snowboarding. 2) I studied film theory, montage theory and created shot lists long before I ever had access to an edit suite. As a result I had a very good theoretical background to editing and shooting before I did any work.For two to three years I would film every theatre production at school as a way to perfect my shooting style. It's demanding when every minute you shoot must be of the highest qualities. 3) In 2003 when I applied to go back to University I was accepted for every course and university I applied to in England. That meant I had a real choice. It's a great feeling. I knew where I wanted to go anyway. 4) In one year I went to Germany, Italy (twice) Poland, England and Switzerland both for pleasure and studies. I love to travel and have been to over 20 countries on three continents by now. It's not much compared to some but it's fun nonetheless. 5) Working at Geneva airport was a really fun job for two reasons. Firstly because it's physically and secondly because it taught me about real teamwork. When you're kneeling in an aircraft hold lifting 20 kilo suitcases 50-70 times within 25 minutes you soon develop physical strength. If someone appears lazy they will be made to work twice as hard. Occasionally those with experience would tell me to work at a slower pace. I'm glad it's not my career but I'm happy I had the experience 6) I dived the English channel in November when the air temperature was hovering around 11Â°C. For the first dive I felt like an idiot and was scared. The visibility was no more than 30 seconds and the water was freezing. I shivered forÂ  at least three hours after the dives. A few months later I dived the same waters and I used a third of a tank in the time it took others to use two thirds :-) 7) I have had content online since late 1996-97. I started by writing about the Romans and putting the content on iprolink, then geocities before finally putting it on main-vision.com. My extended essay was about information technology in a global society back pre 2000. I have always been among the early adopters because I enjoy new technology so much. 8) I hate when people use the word mate because of all the Natural history documentaries I've watched. When you hear about animals mating for a decade or more and people start calling you mate it just feels wrong, especially when it's guys ;-). 8 years in England doesn't make me feel any more comfortable with the term. Now that I've done this I'm tagging the following 8 people: [Phil Campbell](http://www.twitter.com/philcampbell) [Maggie](http://www.twitter.com/maggieconv) [Amanda Gravel](http://www.twitter.com/amandagravel) [Kosso](http://www.twitter.com/kosso) [Shanzan](http://www.twitter.com/shanzan) [Marlooz](http://www.twitter.com/marlooz) [Foulbastard](http://www.twitter.com/foulbastard) [DacortÂ ](http://www.twitter.com/dacort) Now I can get on with something else.
