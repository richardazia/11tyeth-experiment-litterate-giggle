Over the past three days I've been testing [twitterpod](http://drikin.com/twitterpod) and so far I'm quite happy with it. It's an efficient way of keeping track of twitter conversation. What makes this application different from others is the way it archives all tweets you've received. [![Three days](http://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/number.jpg)](http://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/number.jpg "Three days") Over the past three days I've received over 8400 tweets and i can search through them to see my conversation history with all those I follow. Another feature I like is the drawer feature that comes out when I browse over a tweet that has a hyperlink. ![The drawer](http://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/drawer.jpg) The Drawer is great because you don't need to go from one application to another in order to view the hyperlinks. Simly scroll down the list of tweets and find the relevant links. If the link is worth visiting properly then you can view it in another browser window. It's effortless and that's why I love the feature.

There are some keyboard shortcuts like apple 2 to send an @message and apple 3 to open the person's profile page in browser. The final thing is more of a gimmik. if you're just watching twitter without contributing many comments or adding to the conversation then the visualisation tool allows you to have twitter running as a screensaver of sorts. I don't see the appeal but some people might.

I'll continue using this for the moment.
