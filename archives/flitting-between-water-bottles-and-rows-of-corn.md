I thought that when I bought two cycling water bottles and two normal day bottles I would be done, but then I found a nalgene bottle for a reasonable price, and then someone mentioned drinking from a steel container, rather than aluminium so I was distracted and tempted. I did tell myself that this would replace my habit of drinking other types of drinks. I thought "Stop with these drinks for three weeks per bottle and you amortise the cost".

It goes deeper than that. If I stop drinking the two drinks I normally drink, then I will save money within three weeks, and not have to spend it again for weeks at a time. It may be materialist to want more water bottles than I can use in a week, but at least it's a lot less plastic to be recycled on Monday afternoons. I don't mind recycling. I just hate that there are set times when it is possible. I hate that it has to be scheduled, rather than spontaneous.

If I have less aluminium and PET then my trips to recycle are diminished. In reality my goal is just to switch the budget from one luxury to another, without having a new expense. If I find that I am happy with the new system then that is all the better.

[Temptation 1](https://sigg.com/ch/original/?___from_store=en) - to replace the half litre bottle that I use daily, because it's easier to clean

[Temptation 2](https://sigg.com/ch-en/water-bottle-shield-one-brushed-1-0-l/) - to replace the 1l bottle I have used for over ten years, because it is easier to clean, and because it should be easier to carry.

If we were not in a pandemic, and if we were not in a society where people still do not wear their masks properly, and where people respect the 2 meter safety distance then I would go and look at the products in person, and probably lose interest. It's because we're in a long protracted pandemic that I am growing curious about such things. It is a coping mechanism. As dull and boring as it may sound.

A few years ago I looked at mobile phones, new watches, climbing gear etc. Now I'm looking at water bottles. I like water bottles. It is something that you use every day, from the moment you wake up to the moment you go to sleep.

Rows of Corn
------------

Have you ever considered that we always look at rows of corn from the same angle. We always look at them along the line of plantation so all we see is a wall of corn. Today during the walk I saw that some corn had been cut to reveal the seed rows of corn and it's interesting to see the cistern like rows of columns of corn plants.

Rows of corn

It's interesting to see that corridor down which animals and other small creatures can run along. You never think of how distinct it is. You always associate corn fields with a jumble of corn, like a forest of trees. Unlike in old films and cartoons this is highly organised, so walking in one direction is easy, but not perpendicularly.
