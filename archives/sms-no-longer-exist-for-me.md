I saw a tweet saying that Americans now send twice as many text messages as Europeans and this makes me think of just one thing. It's obsolete. What I mean by that is that now that I have a data plan and skype and gtalk on my phone I refuse to send sms which I have to pay for when everyone I know uses at least one IM client. It's so much cheaper (free) for me to chat with you on gtalk. There's also more chance that I'll get an answer. I really don't like the idea of sending sms when there is a better contemporary technology out there costing far less money :-) Just to give you an example. I've been with friends in Geneva and Lausanne chatting with other people via gtalk from bars, restaurants and the living room couch. I've even skype called a friend with the N95 and she's in the US. All of this is free, inclusive data within my contract. I want you to modernise, let's use mobile communication in a more creative way than missed phone calls and unanswered SMS.
