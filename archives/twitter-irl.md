Last night I went to the London twitter meetup and enjoyed the event. I'm used to going out and hearing people talk about music and other things but here is a community that was talking about technology and internet-based activities. [Sizemore](http://www.sizemore.co.uk/) and [Trusted Places](http://trustedplaces.com/) organised the event which took place at the [Ishtar](http://www.ishtarrestaurant.com/) restaurant.

As a result of my taking my camera with me I was put in charge of covering the event whilst [Jess](http://www.jessmccabe.co.uk/) interviewed people about how and why they use twitter. We got some interesting responses from those who use it heavily, less frequently, or have just heard about it. All of this footage is now digitised and should be worked on tomorrow afternoon. Once the footage is edited it may appear on [Geek entertainment TV](http://www.geekentertainment.tv/) as a four or five-minute piece.

What I liked about this event is that its people are interested in and active in new media activities. As I spoke to Loud Mouth Man he told me of his show called the Old Grey video test. It's an interesting program where a group of people with webcams in a number of locations talk to each other via video chat. What makes this particularly interesting is the fact that they're switching from one camera and one person to another camera and another person. It means that you can watch the speakers as they address the issues they have decided to cover for that specific episode.Â  As of yet I've only watched one episode but I will definitely watch the second one very soon.

I also spoke to [Walid](http://trustedplaces.com/user/walid) of [Trustedplaces](http://trustedplaces.com/) and he told me about how they were moving to video reviews as mentioned in their blog. Here is [one example](http://trustedplaces.com/blog/2007/07/24/exmouth-strikes-again/) of the work they're doing.

Pictures of the event can be found [here](http://www.flickr.com/photos/theloudmouthman/sets/72157601336938396/) and [here](http://www.flickr.com/photos/sizemore/sets/72157601342554121/).

Overall the night was well received by the people who participated and I'm already looking forward to the next one in the near future I hope. I'll work on getting the video ready as soon as possible so that you may hear for yourselves what people had to say.
