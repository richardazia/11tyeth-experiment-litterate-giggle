If I had a perfect laptop it would be shaped just like the N97 but larger. I'm saying this because of how much I love having a keyboard and a touchscreen in such a small package. Now imagine if laptops did away with all that wasted space at the bottom, where the trackpad goes. Back to the matter at hand. The N97 is a great little device that can survive about a day with my use before needing a charge. What I like is the duality of control between a keyboard when you slide it from under the display, and the touch interface for those that like that. What makes this touch interface particularly interesting is that it's designed for mobile phone users with a lot of experience with text messaging. It's the standard number and key configuration that we've grown accustomed to over the past decade. There were some issues with stability, crashes display not working all the time and memory issues but those have been patched.
