The Co working space in Lausanne ([ECLAU](http://eclau.ch/)/[FB](http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=38409350862)) is an interesting idea for freelancers and those who have some work to do but do not want to work from home or a cafe. There are desks and couches, a meeting space and more from which individual work and team work can be done. I was there for an Apero last night and got to meet a few of the people. At the moment there are four people there using the space full time and another who go there occasionally. For those like me who go there very occasionaly we can drop by and work there if we so desire. It's easy to get to from the motorway and apparently not too hard from the center of Lausanne. One of the members is a cat, apparently he loves to come in through one window, sleep on the couches and distract certain people before walking out through a window at the other side of the space. What's interesting is that the participants of L'Eclau think of him as a sort of alarm clock. He's there to remind them that they should take a little break from the work they were doing. I know quite a few people in Lausanne now so it might be an interesting place to meet some people when there are some collaborative efforts to be done.
