I have seen combine harvesters at work over the last two days. Yesterday I saw them harvesting [colza](https://colza.ch/), and today I saw them harvesting wheat. At the moment you see grapes that are still in a juvenile state, and apples that look a little more mature, growing on their respective plants.

Apples on an Apple tree

When you walk every single day of the year, you see nature change. You see plants flower, the fruit or nuts grow, the harvest, and then the next crop, You see this all year long. At the moment as I walk by the vineyards I can see the grapes growing every day. They were tiny and unrecognisable and now we can see what they are, but we can see that they still need to grow more juicy and filled with fluid. There is no rush. They have three or four more months.

Despite the rains, the ground is dry again, so it is easy to walk without getting too muddy. The rivers, too, despite the flood warning for big lakes, are low again. The soil around here was not saturated.

Today I was at a petrol station and I could feel that someone was standing right behind me so I asked "pardon me, but could you step two meters back, and could you wear your face mask, as I gestured a mask on my own face. I said all of this automatically, without thought or consideration. It was a reflex. I'm old-fashioned. The limit is one metre, not two. I surprised myself with that reaction.

What's of interest is that I was then thanked by the person at the petrol station because usually he's the one that has to tell them to wear the mask, so I avoided him that unpleasant chore. I think that it might be the first time, this pandemic, that I say this. I haven't been in such a situation as I tried to avoid people for the last 470+ days.
