Today I went for my daily walk and I saw a shape. I thought, "That looks like a fox" and as I approached i had a doubt about it being a dog and I felt fear but I continued forward anyway. Eventually the fox noticed me, looked at me and then fled the other way. This is good news. This means that the fox was healthy, rather than rabied. It also means that I can keep being relaxed about seeing foxes.

Plenty of flowers in a field

At this time of year fields are filled with flowers by the thousands and if you walk around the right fields you hear the buzzing of bees. I didn't hear them today. Summer heat seems to be back now. The thermometer is going up to 26 to 27 degrees. Warm enough to cycle in shorts and not feel cold. This is a nice time of year for such sports. I have cycled 100 kilometres so far and tomorrow I expect to add another 20 to 30 kilometres so I will have reached my pre-pandemic goal for the first time in two or three years. I haven't cycled seriously since I broke my arm.

I have now completed 50 percent of [The Complete JavaScript Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/learn/lecture/22648783?start=0#overview) so I am finally closer to the end than the beginning of this course. I feel that I am learning new and interesting things, as well as consolidating knowledge about other topics. What I am learning about JavaScript can be found [here](https://github.com/richardazia/galivanting-js-practice). This is sorted by learning, rather than projects. I keep this as a notebook rather than a repository for others to use. When I am confident about the projects I am working on I will share them in an organised manner.

Coquelicots, and the Alps
