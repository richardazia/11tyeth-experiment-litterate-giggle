[Behind the Scenes: Record](http://vimeo.com/73003033) from [The Lincoln Motor Company](http://vimeo.com/lincolnmotorco) on [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com).

I love the idea of putting a small camera on an object and filming event from that perspective. The idea of putting a gopro on a record is an interesting one. With the size of technology today you'd expect this to be simple to do. I was disappointed to see that what they did for this video clip was to build a camera rig for a Red Epic and get the camera to spin. The second fallacy is the amount of time for which the record is speeding at "normal speed". The image is blurred for too long before it goes to slow motion images. By that time I pressed pause and looked at the making of. As a person who loves the documentary genre and cinema veritÃ© this manufactured reality feels like a cheap lie rather than innovative experimentation.
