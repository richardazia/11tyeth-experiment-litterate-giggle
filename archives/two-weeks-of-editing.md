Two weeks of editing await me. Both projects have been logged for the most part although now it's a matter of finding out how to unite all the raw footage, something which may take a few hours. It should be a matter of going through the material and choosing all the most relevant bits, seeing whether they go well together, and then finalising that. Tomorrow I have to work on the documentary. We've got a lot of interviews although I'm worried about the shots that can be used for illustrative purposes. I don't think there are that many location shots, just interview after interview. Tomorrow we'll see how well they go together.
