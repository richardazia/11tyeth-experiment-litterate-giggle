A walk from one forest to another from Founex to Arnex.

Sometimes we walk in the rain and the snow and we get soaked by the weather. Today I drank a litre in an hour and a half of walking. The air temperature is around 31c.

I decided to walk from clump of trees to clump of trees. Itâ€™s possible. If I had walked in the direct sun I would have needed to drink more than I did.

31 might seem warm but we had 37 for days in a row during previous years. This year has been gentle.
