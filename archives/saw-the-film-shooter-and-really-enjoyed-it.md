Last night I was feeling good about how my dissertation was going so I got my shoes on and walked to the cinema, feeling good about what I had achieved in the day. I went from my dissertation being a collection of words on the computer to it being printed out for visual inspection. What I found as I looked through the thousands of words I have written is that I am quite happy with the way it's going and thought that I'm going to meet the target date for the handing in earl, if everything goes well from here on. When I went to see Shooter I really enjoyed the film. I often find that I prefer war films to other genres because although the story format is always the same the way the story is more engaging than many of the other styles of films. It's great fun to watch explosions, to watch works of great precision. I also approve of the choice of women selected for the film. It's a nice distraction from what I've spent most of my time looking at recently. i.e. words on a screen. I'd recommend people to see it.
