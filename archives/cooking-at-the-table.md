It's a wooden tray with two sauces on the left, a dish to the right with chips, at the back some vegetables. Front and centre you find a slab of stone. It's very hot. That's because it's Entrecote sur ardoise, similar to a steak. There's a hot slab of stone and you use it to cook your meal on top. It's delicious.
