For a few weeks you see piles of sugar beet at one end, or another of fields. They stay that way for a while, until it rains for some reason. When it rains those piles of beet are loaded into hundreds of tractor trailer loads and transported to the train yard. The closest to Nyon is in Eysins.

A tractor lifting a trailer to unload sugar beet into a machine to load train wagons.

During this time you see two things. Tractors going back and forth from the fields to the loading yard all day long filled with sugar beet and muddy roads. I don't know whether they wait for the rain to clean the sugar beets before moving them, or if the wagons just happen to be free when the rain falls. In either case the roads around this train stop are covered in mud. It's dangerous for scooters and bikes at this time of year.

Sometimes you see six to eight tractors with their loads parked with a sheet of paper with "25m3" or some other reading. Apparently the farmers drive their tractors to be unloaded and seem to leave them there either because it's lunchtime, or because they are waiting for the train or loaders to get more wagons ready.

It would be interesting to pick up one or two sugar beets that fell by the side of the road during transport and try to [process the beets to make sugar.](https://www.instructables.com/Making-Sugar-From-Sugar-Beets/)

I walk almost every day, and by walking I see the seasonal changes in fields, and the different stages of different plants. We can all get in cars, drive for an hour, and walk for an hour but I prefer to walk locally, to see local seasonal changes, and to avoid spending money on petrol. I also like to reduce my carbon footprint, by driving less.

That's it for now.
