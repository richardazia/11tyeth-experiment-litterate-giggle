Today I went for a run earlier than usual and had to deal with mischievous shoelaces. They decided to come undone at least three times during the first three kilometres before I finally got them to behave.

I went for a run earlier than usual because rain is forecast for this afternoon and if I go after lunch then I get rained on. I prefer not to run in the rain, if I can avoid it.

It rained anyway, but light rain. The type that doesn't soak your clothes and you down to the bone. It was rain that is noticed, but doesn't stick around. It evaporates by the time you're done with the run.

Today's run was meant to be a 5.6km run and I did run most of the distance, except for the three stops to retie shoe laces, and a short walk when I felt I didn't have much energy after yet another climb. A run that should have taken half an hour took fourty minutes. I did not feel as energetic as sometimes and this wasn't helped by having to stop and start a few times.

I'm on week 11 of 12 of this training program so when next week is done I will be able to try another training program. The aim will still be 5k, but with a better time.

And Finally
-----------

I am trying to develop a running habit but I still don't enjoy it. I still struggle to run the required distance. With cycling I struggle to go at a certain speed, or over a specific distance but I don't find it as hard. Walking comes naturally to me. I don't struggle. Walking and cycling feel natural. I haven't reached that, with cycling. The day that I can daydream whilst running is the day that I will have achieved my goal.
