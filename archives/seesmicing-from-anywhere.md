I like to seesmic but there's no way I want to be stuck in one place without moving around. It's more fun when you see people aren't in a desk situation. Here are four places from which to seesmic and make things more interesting. Seesmic from here.[![](http://seesmic.com/images/spacer.gif)](http://seesmic.com) The Lake Side Yet another nice view[![](http://seesmic.com/images/spacer.gif)](http://seesmic.com) The Mountains Nice view[![](http://seesmic.com/images/spacer.gif)](http://seesmic.com) And where to have lunch :-)
