Over the last few weeks I have been thinking about the absurdity of life during this pandemic. People are pretending the pandemic is over and falling sick with a disease that keeps them sick for months.

Entire professions are now unstable so finding work is harder.

Millions of others are unable to work.

Living with COVID is absurd. I wish the world would stop being absurd. I am tired of the absurdity of people being okay with living in a pandemic.

I would spend more time writing this blog post but part of the absurdity that I am writing about is that I do not have the space to work towards my personal goals, so my days are absurd. I am in limbo and I can't change it until I regain my normal life, a life that is not as absurd.
