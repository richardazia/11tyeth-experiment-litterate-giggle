It seems that the iPhone is very different there in terms of service contracts. My service contract includes 900 'daytime' minutes, but is a two year contract. Data and texting is included. It's about 90USD/month after taxes and all. I would honestly rather have one device to charge than 2-3 devices (PDA, MP3 player, and phone). Being able to charge over USB (which most other devices don't) is another major plus. My Treo needed a USB cable to sync and a DC cable to charge. Bother were larger than the iPhone usb cable, and it was only USB 1. The keyboard is more than able for typing. I can't type while driving anymore, but 1) I no longer drive in Boston and 2) That sounds like a safety feature to me. I don't think I'm really any slower on this than I was on my Treo 650. Neither could really be used well with gloves (treo due to inaccuracy, the iphone due to the screen). Someone needs to make gloves with fake skin on the fingertips for iphone typing. The iPod Touch is a nice alternative. I'm waiting for someone to crack a VoIP/SIP phone onto it.
