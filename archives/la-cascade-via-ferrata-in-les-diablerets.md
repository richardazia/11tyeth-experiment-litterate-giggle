This year I finally got to see the Via Ferrata of the Waterfall (La Cascade Via ferrata) in Les Diablerets Switzerland. As a child it is a place where we would walk as children and experience the freezing river water. A few days ago I went for the via ferrata. It was amusing to be with friends rather than family. As I know this landscape so well the effort felt minimal. The Via ferrata is a nice medium via ferrata. I'm tempted to say that I found it easy but that's going to mislead people and I don't want them to get stuck. According to the [geotrails](http://www.geotrails.ch/tourismvd/detail.php?PHPSESSID=857d3aa7b91b1fb3f2fccff9adcfe30e&trailid=124279)Â post this is a demanding VF because of the overhanging bits. That's where doing one or two VF a week pays off. If I was to do this via ferrata alone I would park at the MontÃ©e mecanique of Isenau, take the egg up to the top and then walk down by the lake and towards the Glacier 3000 lift. From there I would cross over to the via ferrata on the other side. Access to the via ferrata is quick and the path is easy. The Via Ferrata has some vertical moments but most of the time you are moving laterally. You have a very nice view of the valley below.

I recommend keeping yourself attached to the via ferrata cable. Two people slipped on the soil and it's a useful habit always to stay attached when the option is available. From the flat section you climb a little and then head back down through a split between two rocks. From this point you can head down and consider the via ferrata complete or you can have fun and try the tyrollean. The tyrollean will require you to walk along some slippy rocks to where the platform is. Here you can attach yourself and enjoy the first tyrollean across to the other side. It's not the fastest tyrollean I have done but it's the first time I pass under a waterfall and that is fun. When you get to this side you detach, walk down for a short distance and can cross over again. The second tyrollean is slow and there is a good chance that you will have to pull yourself across as I did. At this point you can follow the path down towards Les Diablerets along the river and back to where the car is parked.
