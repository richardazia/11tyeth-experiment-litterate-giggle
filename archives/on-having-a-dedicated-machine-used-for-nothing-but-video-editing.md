My editing machine has a minimum of things installed on it. Final Cut Pro and related software, nothing else. The point is that when I am editing I am dedicated to that single task. I take breaks when it is rendering or when I need time to digest the edit so far. When I was editing over a decade ago I would mark 10 in and out points and then go and drink some ice tea while the machine assembled the footage. Later when I moved to desktop editing I would let the computer render and take a break. Today with the current system taking breaks is based on scene completion. That's how a friend and I worked on our fiction film over a period of weeks. Right now the rough cut is ready. We need to add music, improve the sound, colour correct and more but at least a big step was taken.
