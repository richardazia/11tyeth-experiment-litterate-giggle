The walk from Paquis to Decathlon can be almost straight if you take the most direct route. You walk from anywhere in Paquis to the train station and from there you head up towards Balexert and from there you head along the cycle and walking paths that veer slightly to the right, take you over the motorway and then to the airport, by the private aviation terminal. From there the rest of the walk takes a few minutes.

This is similar to the walk I used to do from the old town to Meyrin. The walk is not that interesting. It takes you along the same route as the tram takes you, for almost the entire journey. For a brief moment, you see some smaller, more personal buildings along one road.

If I had known that the more interesting bit of the walk would be on the way back I would have tracked that and taken pictures. There are apartment blocks like in other parts of Geneva but they're separate, with green space. I also saw a row of older houses along the Avenue de [Riant Parc](https://www.google.com/maps/@46.2184716,6.1175656,128m/data=!3m1!1e3).

When you go by car you go along two or three routes. When you're on foot or on a bike you explore more. You're going at a speed where you can look around. You're also going at a rate where traffic lights are less of a concern.

I notice that there are a lot of electric bikes and electric scooters. People are using these two forms of transport. The sun is shining and the temperatures are good. This makes alternative forms of transport more attractive.
