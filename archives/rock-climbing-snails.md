For several weeks now it has rained almost every day and almost every weekend. As a result of this rain acitivities have been cancelled. On Sunday we were meant to go outdoor climbing and when we got to the wall we found a rock climbing snail where, in dry weather we could have enjoyed some good climbs. The climbing site in [St Triphon](http://www.st-triphon.ch/varappe/varappe.html) has about 150 climbing routes of differing climbing difficulties.

It rained as we drove to the climbing site, it started to get brighter and then it started to rain hard again. As we drove away from the climbing wall where snails were climbing instead of humans we saw that the weather improvedÂ as we got to Lausanne.

A welcoming wall.

[![A welcoming Wall](http://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0289-768x1024.jpg)](http://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/DSC_0289.jpg) Rocspot in Echandens was in the sun yesterday. It was quiet enough to make choosing which route to climb possible. The core of our group climbs every thursday night, as a result of which we are developing the right muscles to make climbing easier. Other group members climbed less frequently so we could prepare the top ropeÂ for them to attempt routes. The practice is good as we share skills and experiences with more people. During this climbing day I was able to challenge myself to 5c, 5c+ and 6a routes. I found that there were moments when I struggled to make progress but overall I felt good. It was interesting to watch the less experienced climbers try routes and manage them. As they climb less frequently they allowed us to see where we would have struggled in the past. A noticeable difference  Aside from rock climbing and bouldering there is a wall with various hand holds. A few weeks ago when I tried to pull myself up using finger strength I was barely able to hang on for more than a few seconds before letting go. Now I can climb up almost to the top. This is the clearest demonstration that I have made progress. It also shows why certain muscle groups ached so much after every session. The fatigue was worth it for this result. Now that the weekend is over the sun is shining again and I do look forward to climbing and practicing more skills.
