Yesterday I made a phone call after writing an e-mail to see about getting cheaper accomodation through one method and it went well. I'm going to be back in London tomorrow, once I've finished packing all my stuff into a suitcase. It's the usual good and bad. It's good because although I'm leaving my skills are still in demand so there's a chance I'll be in demand when I get back. it's It's good because I'm looking forward to being back in England and getting this final year out of the way. It's bad because I would prefer to do another year of uni rather than being a student. I met some interesting people and it's a shame I'm leaving. Tomorrow is the moment when I put Geneva on hold and take my London life out of standby.
