Today I started following the "[Building Progressive Themes with](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/wordpress-building-progressive-themes-with-wp-rig-2?contextUrn=urn%3Ali%3AlyndaLearningPath%3A5754fc1f92015af148c66fd8) [WP Rig](https://wprig.io/)." course on Linkedin Learning.

Before you start playing with WP Rig make sure that you have installed [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/). Composer is required to use WP Rig during the build process. Composer itself requires that you have [PHP on your machine](https://windows.php.net/download#php-7.4). After that it should be easier to use. I also ran [npm-install-peers](https://github.com/spatie/npm-install-peers) because I kept getting error messages.

During the daily walk today I saw that the grass along the side of the road is dry and dead. It crunshes as you walk on it. As you look at other fields they are dry and probably crunchy too. We had some rain a few days ago, but within minutes of the rain stopping the landscape was dry again. We never get rain. I am impatient for a day of rain. I am impatient to look forward to good weather, rather than bad. It seems to be absurd to want rain in Switzerland. In winter skiers and snowboarders want snow.

I managed a 179 day reading streak with the kindle before I broke it. It wasn't that I didn't read, but that I didn't read using the kindle. It's frustrating to lose such a streak because it will take 179 days to get back to the same point. It makes no sense to reach for such a goal in the first place. These apps that get you to do things for an unlimited days in a row detract from the pleasure of doing certain things habitually. I have read a book every day for many months, probably years, but I use Audible, Kobo, physical books and the Kindle. I need to find an app to track reading streaks without it being locked in to one book store.
