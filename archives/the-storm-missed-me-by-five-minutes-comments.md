We've had some seriously unpredictable weather lately around here. Storms expected that don't happen, unexpected storms that do, surprise sunny days, surprise humidity... Whew! Glad you missed that storm. Walking and the rain is one thing, but that sort of massive storm (replete with lightning!) would not have been safe.
