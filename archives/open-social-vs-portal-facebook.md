Loudmouthman, amongst others was expressing his desire for a means by which to aggregate all our online data through one central account. I though of Freebase and Openid and how they could work. Google though had other thoughts. Whilst Facebook behaves like a portal opensocial helps agggregate content. Facebook assumes thatyou come to their website, spen an hour there and then disconnect. Opensocial assumes that you are an active participant of the new socialmedia landscape on several websites at a time. We currently have a growing number of people that spend more and more time using new technologies to communicate with others. Most of us have flickr accounts, joost accounts youtube and more but for our friends to keep up is a challenge. Getting them to sign on to any social network is particularly hard. Myspace was the key website for a while before facebook overtook. In the past two days I've joined [Lijit](http://www.lijit.com/users/warzabidul) and Open Social. Both work the same way. They take your user id. in my case [warzabidul](http://www.lijit.com/users/warzabidul) and you tell them which networks you're part of. The content is then aggregated to a central pag. As more and more friends join open social and lijit so you should get a greater sense of what they are up to. It's a convenient way to keep up to date with what friends around the world are doing. Look at the sidebar to get an idea of how Plaxo Pulse is using the opensocial idea. [Florian Seroussi](http://cizake.blogspot.com/) also pointed me to [this article](http://mashable.com/2007/11/02/plaxo-pulse-opensocial/) that should help you understand what it's about. I'm looking forward to more people using it and I love the great flexibility that it will give it's users. If you're using it them write a comment and I'll visit your site to see your social media presence.
