If you're looking for an interesting food experience then you should drop by Laguna, a tropical restaurant a few minutes out of Geneva. There's a meal there that's really good called la plancha. The concept is simple. Food is laid out buffet style so you chose the ingredients you want and chose from onions, lettuce, coriander before selecting the types of meat. The meat on offer when I went to was lamb, beef, horse, pork, and chicken. Once you've filled your plate with all the ingredients you go over to a large metallic platter where the chef will prepare the food you've selected as you wait. Once it's ready you go back to your table and enjoy the meal. You can repeat this process as often as you like. The clientele is also interesting, being a mix between parents and young children, couples, and more. It's in a relaxed atmosphere where you hear the birds tweeting and nature rather than urban sounds. You're also surrounded by furniture from tropical locations. The food is good, the atmosphere is good and the type of people make this a nice evening place where to get a nice meal. I'll be thinking of going there more than once.
