Twice yesterday I was surprised at how fast the new ipod detects networks. The first time was in one of wagamama's restaurants. It found ten within two seconds of opening up the application. The second time was in a block of flats. Both times it detected the networks within a matter of seconds. It's a shame youtube isn't working on the Touch Ipod at the moment.
