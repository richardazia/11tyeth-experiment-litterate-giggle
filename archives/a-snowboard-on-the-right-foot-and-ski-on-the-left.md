I just remembered that I had a strange dream this morning. I was with some friends catching a telesiège and for some reason, I had a snowboard on one foot and a ski on the other. I had hurried to get ready as my friends were already near the remontÃ©e mechanique. It was a low altitude resort I think because there were a few trees although the powder was quite nice. It was a strange sensation to have such different tools on my feet. I don't know why I'm dreaming of such things when it's summer outside.
