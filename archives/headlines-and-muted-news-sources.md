I have started to mute news sources that provide us with headlines that tell us how to feel rather than give us information about the content of the article. On Facebook the alternative would be to unfollow people I have met in person, friends. I prefer to mute news sources and get updates from friends. We will see when social media "experts" and headline writers go back to writing headlines that tell us about the content of articles.
