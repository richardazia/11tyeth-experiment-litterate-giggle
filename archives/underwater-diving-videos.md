I've been watching a series of underwater diving videos from around the world from the website [divefilm](http://www.divefilm.com/ "Divefilm") and there are a number of interesting ones. Most of them are by the same person but occasionally there are guest appearances by those aiming to protect whales, others aiming to protect dolphins. There are also some videos showing the "shower" fish, those cleaning other fish. It's an interesting collection of videos. A little different from other videos I've watched.
