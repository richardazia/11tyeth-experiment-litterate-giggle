Piclens is a plugin for Firefox and it's great fun to use to look through hundreds to thousands of pictures and videos on youtube, facebook, flickr and many other sites. It's worth playing with. [piclens](http://www.piclens.com/welcome/firefox-welcome_16.php?v=1.7.0.3459) Other than that the threaded seesmic player is quite fun. You can follow full conversations and get a taste of how discussions progress through the tweets.
