At the moment quite a few of the podcasts I listen to have been speaking about audiobooks and how practical they are for people who communicate and I decided that I would try this out for myself. Since I am not always the most effective person at getting things done I decided that I would get [The Now habit](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1585425524/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=richardazia-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=1585425524&linkId=af87238e2824c3b3f8dd7af69cdb1644 "The Now Habit - Amazon.com").

The book, written by Neil A. Fiore takes a look at how we spend our time and how to avoid procrastinating as much as we do. It takes a look at a number of situations from corporate environment, through physical sports and activities to arrive at the dissertation writing student and how goo they are at wasting time.

Having listened to almost the entire book he has mentioned some elements that I found I have been applying to my life before reading the book, mainly doing just a few minutes at a time for bigger projects rather than forcing myself to do several hours in one go. This was particularly useful when working on the dissertation.

You know what it's like. You've got a report to write and you feel that you should do it all at once but this is not the right mentality because the task is too daunting to do, which results in procrastination. There are a number of tasks he recommends including the unschedule, giving yourself a time limit as to how much time to spend on a project per week. He also recommends to play hard. All of these things are common sense but through case studies you may find solutions that may help you with challenges that are affecting you.

He has made some interesting remarks on university students and how those who do their dissertation in one year rather than two or three do better because as well as setting time aside each day to work on their dissertations they also take the time to enjoy themselves and relax.

From what I've read so far this is a good book, helping understand that there is no need to spend all your time on a task and that projects can be worked on in stages over a longer period of time than you may originally assume. Thinking of such things can help improve your quality of life and help make your life more bearable.
