#### Seven Minute Workout for 36 days

For about six weeks I have been trying to do at least one seven-minute workout every single day. I eventually fell out of the habit for a few days because I had to fight a little virus. I'm feeling better again. Time to see if I can beat my old maximum of 36 days.

#### At least one circuit a day

The [Seven-minute app](http://perigee.se/apps/seven/) I was playing with is by Perigee. The app provides you with the opportunity to train for fitness, for strength or to lose weight. I tried to last for seven days on the Fitness program and suffered. I managed to stick with the routine for a week once as a challenge. Now I choose the routine that I feel I am most in the mood for. On some days I choose a stretching routine and on others I choose to push myself. I tried a chest workout and I found it hard. Yesterday I went for an animal routine and it was easy.

#### Workout to your day's energy level

The beauty of these apps is that as you get familiar with them you can give yourself different intensity workouts depending on the time of day and how you're feeling. You can start with one of the morning routines if you like or an office chair workout. When you've finished with a run you can stretch or you can do the post workout routine.

#### Chose the trainer

I tried the drill sergeant for a while but he frustrated me so I tried the hippie and the kung fu master (or whatever name they used for the app). I have settled for the cheerleader. If I met someone that cheerful in real life I'd probably avoid them but for the workouts it's nice. I'm usually working out either an hour before bed or more recently before dinner. This is the best time when I can decompress from the commute.

#### Complimentary

These workouts are complimentary to the rest of my day. I have started training with the c25k app once again and I'm trying not to push too hard. Eventually I want to get to 10km runs and beyond but only when my body can keep up. During week days I walk at least 2 and a half kilometres to work and back as well as walk during my lunch break. Today was an average day and I walked up the equivalent of fifty floors. The 7 minute app is just a bonus.

#### Motivation

I've tried a few of these apps and after less than a week I usually stop using them because they're either too expensive or they're a good challenge but not much more. With this app I like that you get badges for the challenges you accomplish. I My goal with this app is to go for seven months without missing a single workout. I managed for 36 days and now I have to start all over. I'm on day 8 of the current challenge. When I finish typing this blog post I will have accomplished day 9. If you threw in some running between workouts then it would be just like parkour vita. That's what they should do next. 12 exercises with three or four minutes of running between routines. By the end, you'd be exhausted. With perseverance, you'd be fit. Or you could just do crossfit.
