One of the great things about using the word Autumn, rather than Fall, is that we can say that something looks Autumnal. We can say it with a single word. With the word Fall, you need to add context. Fall sounds like something people do when they make a mistake and lose their balance. I prefer Autumn, it is a nicer word.

Autumn colours - a tree that is turning

At least the colours are changing, and the weather is still for t-shirts. It is still warm. I am uninspired to write today.
