The first time I went to St Hilaire du Touvet was for the Coupe D'Icare event which is held every September. It is a mountain film festival and parapente competition. The second time I went was with Glocals friends to climb up the via ferrata. There are two routes up. One is an easier one. The second is a hard one. What makes the second one so hard is that it's vertical, up a chimney of sorts. What made me uncomfortable was the friable nature of the rock. I thought that if I fell the spikes would not hold. A few weeks later I found out that this is one of the hardest via ferrata, supposedly the hardest via ferrata in France. The video above is nothing like that. They're climbing up the beautiful waterfall that the via ferrata goes along. I was attracted by the width of the water fall.
