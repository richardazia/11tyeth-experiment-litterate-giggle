We need to take time to think. We need to avoid external stimuli and spend time with our thoughts. We desire to move and to achieve which drives the economy forward at the cost of forgetting to give ourselves times. The talk explores time and space. It also explores the popular concept of going offline to recharge. In my experience moving from one social network to another has the same impact as taking a social media break but this after 20 years of trial and error.
