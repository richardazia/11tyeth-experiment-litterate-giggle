Thermal inversions are a great part of life in valleys. Whilst you're living down in the glacial trough you're waking up every morning to the knowledge that you won't see the sun for the next few days... until the wind shifts. If you've got the time during daylight hours though you have the option of going up to the mountains. It's at this point that you can enjoy the sun. As you walk in the Jura at the moment you'll find that there are long plaques of ice and they're slippy whilst in direct sunlight. In the shade traction from normal shoes is possible and walking is not that complicated. There are different types of ice, that which is transparent, where you see the leaves and other objects, that which is white, from too much oxygen and then the mixture where it's a little of both. Many families were walking today, some were struggling and others treated the landscape like a giant playground. Some people spoke French, others, German, Italian, Spannish and more. It was international. Sometimes when I walk there are hardly any sounds and it's good, a break from London and student life.
