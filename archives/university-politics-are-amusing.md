There is a rumour that the person that is running should not be doing so and as a result, there are bits of information coming out about this. It's interesting because I did not want the person to become SU president due to her canceling an interview for a live Multicam I was producing in my second year. There is information that leads us to conclude that she should not be running for her position and I find this is amusing. It's student politics at their best. I spent at least six hours last night chatting to many friends, both on campus and within the SU bar and it's been a really good afternoon-Evening-Night-Morning. If only all days were like that, full of conversations.
