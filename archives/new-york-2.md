10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80. The doors open. I walk forward a little more, a picture is taken, go up another 6 floors and I'm on an observation deck. That's the experience people get as they go up to the observation deck of the empire state building. It's amusing because although the view is great it doesn't feel that high, probably because the structure is so massive compared to other parts of the world. What you see are many buildings, some sticking out by themselves and others clustered together. There are a lot of sky scrapers although it's hard to see them with the haze. When down at ground level you see the valleys or canyons of buildings. Structures are tall requiring you to look up more than usual to see the top. The streets are long and straight making it easier to see for miles. The taxis and buses are numerous. The emergency services always have the lights on which is different from other countries I've visited. During my time in New york I visited a number of sights around the city. I went to Ellis Island, Statten Island and Liberty Island. Manhattan itself is an island connected by several famous bridges and a number of tunnels.
