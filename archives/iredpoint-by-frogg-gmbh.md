The Apple watch and other devices have integrated barometers that allow them to track changes in altitude. [Iredpoint](https://frogg.io/climbing/) by [Frogg GMBH](https://frogg.io/) is one app that takes advantage of this. It allows you to tell the app what type of climbing you are doing as well as the difficulty.

Types of Climbing
-----------------

This app allows you to choose the type of climbing that you are doing. You can choose between bouldering, top rope climbing, sport climbing, trad climbing, multirope climbing, free solo, aid climbing and last, and most awesome of all, Via Ferrata. I'm pleasantly surprised by that last one. In summer this is one of my favourite pass times.

You can let the app know what type of climbing you are doing.

Climbing Grade
--------------

Right before you start ascending a route you can tell the app of the gradient that you are about to climb and this includes American, European and other gradients. For Via ferrata for example you can choose between the French PD, AD, ED and other ratings of the German number system

I am still learning how to use this app

When I tried this app at Vitam Park I made sure to state the gradient and then started to climb. You see that the height information is correct. For the second climb I did the same. For consequent climbs I did not select a difficulty gradient or took breaks on the route and you can see that the graph does not include the full climb. For future versions of this app I would like it to take the starting altitude as a base and combine climbs until the correct height is reached.

I started by climbing one top rope but subsequent climbs were bottom roped and I would like the ability, while tracking to switch between the two, as well as when I have finished climbing for the day.

Heart rate was not tracked.

This is an app with great potential and I see myself using it from now on. What I love about this app is that it tracks data while you are climbing rather than just the climb and the grade. I like that it offers such a diversity of climbing options. I will use it when I do via ferrata. I look forward to Spring and Summer when I can use it outdoors.
