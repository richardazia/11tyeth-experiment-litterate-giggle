Once more twitter has shown it's value. An earthquake occured earlier this morning and people started to twitter about it within half an hour. people like Robert Scoble started linking to the story. It took at least an hour for most of the major networks to start speaking about this news. There's a lag of course, as journalists have to do some research, get some reports and distribute them. I did a search on the twitter search engine flaptor and here is [a little taste](http://twittersearch.flaptor.com/search/search.do?tz=2&orderBy=timestamp%3Along%3Areversed&query=China+Earthquake) of the content of those tweets. Here is [another source of tweets](http://summize.com/search?q=earthquake).
