Qik is a service that allows you to stream video straight from your S60 enabled mobile phone (n95 and others) to the web. They've received [more funding](http://www.dmwmedia.com/news/2008/04/11/qik-lands-%243-million-live-mobile-video-streaming). i hope this means new functionality and an even better user interface.
