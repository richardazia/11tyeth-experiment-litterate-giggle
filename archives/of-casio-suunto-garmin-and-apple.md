These four brands create watches. Casio creates rugged watches with batteries that last for a decade or more, and pair with mobile phones to track walks and more. Suunto and Garmin have fitness/sports trackers that measure activities, whether sailing, climbing, running, walking, cycling, scuba diving or more. Apple in contrast creates fragile, mediocre watches that cost as much as mid to high range watches and yet their battery lasts for one day, if you're lucky. I even heard that Apple watches with 4g last half a day between charges. Charging a watch twice a day is unacceptable.

The [article](https://www.imore.com/health-fitness/apple-watch/apple-watch-is-so-dominant-it-shifted-the-entire-smartwatch-market-with-one-new-product) that triggered this reaction says that the Apple Watch encourages people to spend more on smartwatches, as if this was a good thing. It isn't. These are throwaway products. The type of people that would buy an apple watch plan to change it every two years.

If you pay 800 USD for a watch I'd expect to keep it for a decade or more, not two watch generations, two years.

I might have bought two or three devices recently and the one that I am happiest with is one of the cheapest options. The Garmin Forerunner 45s. For 100 CHF you have a GPS sports tracker that tracks your runs, walks, bike rides and more. The battery does last for three or four workouts before needing a charge but it gives you all the functionality you need, for a fraction of the price, and it's small.

I don't want the Apple Watch to be dominant, because I see it as a crap product, and I feel that such a product pulls down the rest of the market. I slid away from Suunto because of WearOS and I gravitate towards Garmin because it still has proprietary software for the moment. I don't want a smart watch. I want a sports tracker. I also want it to be affordable.
