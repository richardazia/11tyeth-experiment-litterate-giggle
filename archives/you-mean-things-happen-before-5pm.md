If you've ever worked with students or you've ever had a few good nights in a row there's a rule everyone lives by. That rule is that nothing shall be done before 5am, whether it's consuming a good meal, putting on clothing other than pyjamas or other. It's a time when everyone rests. Especially on a sunday. I was out by 930 today because I had to travel across London for a shoot with some students for the rag week. I don't know much about the thing but it seems typical of pre 1970's universities where they are bound by an extended legacy. My uni seems to lack this unfortunatly. I don't often shoot and edit a piece on the same day. I usually take my time and eventually get round to it. At least today was different. It's been a good weekend.
