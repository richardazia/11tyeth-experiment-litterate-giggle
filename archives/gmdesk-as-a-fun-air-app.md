Gmail, google Calendar and google maps are part of our daily workflow. As a result of this we have them running in two or three tabs at all times. Switching between tabs within a browser can be time consuming but not between applications. That's where Adobe Air and [GMDesk](http://www.robertnyman.com/gmdesk/) come in. Adobe Air is a multiplatform solution to make running the same app on multiple machines easy. GMDesk is an application that allows you to use the applications I have mentioned above easily. Work in your web browser, alt tab and you're in GMdesk.

It's an interesting idea and we should be seeing many more applications such as this in the near future.
