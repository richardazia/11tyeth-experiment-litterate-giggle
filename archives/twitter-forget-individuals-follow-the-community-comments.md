And from Twitter, you discover their blogs or the blogs they are reading, the videos they watch, the things they are thinking about which only leads to more people and more Twitters. I like how Twitter has shrunk the world for me so that my neighborhood isn't just a geographical region of Flint Michigan in the United States. It includes people from Chicago and San Francisco, from London and Paris and .. Twitter is product reviews and conference debriefings. Thank you for your thoughtful explanation, one I plan to share
