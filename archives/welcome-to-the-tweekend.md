The tweekend is a weekend spent reading twitter posts by all those you are following. I found out about this word earlier today because i am following [twitionary,](http://twitter.com/Twitionary) an amusing dictionary that takes twitter terminology and brings it into every day parlance. No self respecting twitterholic should live without it. Kidding aside another twittervox took place with [Loudmouthman](http://www.loudmouthman.com), [Documentally](http://www.twitter.com/documentally) and the ever present [PhilCampbell](http://me.dm/). We discussed why it is that whilst in America everyone Loudmouthman met had twitter at podcamp whilst n the UK the opposite was true. We also took a look at why Documentally created [twitterposer](http://twitterposter.com/), a spoof of [twitterposter](http://twitterposter.com/). If you'd like to view the show then drop by the [Tweekend episode](http://operator11.com/shows/3235/episodes/28664) now.
