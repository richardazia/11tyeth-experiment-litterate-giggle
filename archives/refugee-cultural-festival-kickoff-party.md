Last night many of the volunteers participating in the [Refugee Cultural Festival](http://www.refugeeculturalfestival.ch) could come and meet who they will be working with for the duration of the event. Falafel, samosa, hummus, wine and beer were among the offerings available to those people. Along with this was a drive for them to tell their stories either as migrants, refugees or allies of both. This is within the framework of the [I am a Migrant campaign](http://iamamigrant.org) by the [International Organisation for Migration.](https://www.iom.int/) As usual with most Geneva events this was a culturally diverse group of people. Just an ordinary day in Geneva but special for those who have not grown up with such cultural diversity. The Refugee Cultural Festival itself will take place on two key dates. The first of these is the [17th of June](https://www.facebook.com/pg/refugeeculturalfestival/events/?ref=page_internal). The Swiss National day of the refugee. On this day there will be singing, [dancing](https://www.facebook.com/events/308035406305980/?acontext=%7B%22source%22%3A5%2C%22page_id_source%22%3A419227831766486%2C%22action_history%22%3A[%7B%22surface%22%3A%22page%22%2C%22mechanism%22%3A%22main_list%22%2C%22extra_data%22%3A%22%7B%5C%22page_id%5C%22%3A419227831766486%2C%5C%22tour_id%5C%22%3Anull%7D%22%7D]%2C%22has_source%22%3Atrue%7D), [international karaoke](https://www.facebook.com/events/218444735334194/?acontext=%7B%22source%22%3A5%2C%22page_id_source%22%3A419227831766486%2C%22action_history%22%3A[%7B%22surface%22%3A%22page%22%2C%22mechanism%22%3A%22main_list%22%2C%22extra_data%22%3A%22%7B%5C%22page_id%5C%22%3A419227831766486%2C%5C%22tour_id%5C%22%3Anull%7D%22%7D]%2C%22has_source%22%3Atrue%7D), [discussions](https://www.facebook.com/events/133149640591065/?acontext=%7B%22source%22%3A5%2C%22page_id_source%22%3A419227831766486%2C%22action_history%22%3A[%7B%22surface%22%3A%22page%22%2C%22mechanism%22%3A%22main_list%22%2C%22extra_data%22%3A%22%7B%5C%22page_id%5C%22%3A419227831766486%2C%5C%22tour_id%5C%22%3Anull%7D%22%7D]%2C%22has_source%22%3Atrue%7D), [music](https://www.facebook.com/events/1436948473036267/?acontext=%7B%22source%22%3A5%2C%22page_id_source%22%3A419227831766486%2C%22action_history%22%3A[%7B%22surface%22%3A%22page%22%2C%22mechanism%22%3A%22main_list%22%2C%22extra_data%22%3A%22%7B%5C%22page_id%5C%22%3A419227831766486%2C%5C%22tour_id%5C%22%3Anull%7D%22%7D]%2C%22has_source%22%3Atrue%7D), [yoga](https://www.facebook.com/events/729134443958621/?acontext=%7B%22source%22%3A5%2C%22page_id_source%22%3A419227831766486%2C%22action_history%22%3A[%7B%22surface%22%3A%22page%22%2C%22mechanism%22%3A%22main_list%22%2C%22extra_data%22%3A%22%7B%5C%22page_id%5C%22%3A419227831766486%2C%5C%22tour_id%5C%22%3Anull%7D%22%7D]%2C%22has_source%22%3Atrue%7D), [photography](https://www.facebook.com/events/1809331679365162/?acontext=%7B%22source%22%3A5%2C%22page_id_source%22%3A419227831766486%2C%22action_history%22%3A[%7B%22surface%22%3A%22page%22%2C%22mechanism%22%3A%22main_list%22%2C%22extra_data%22%3A%22%7B%5C%22page_id%5C%22%3A419227831766486%2C%5C%22tour_id%5C%22%3Anull%7D%22%7D]%2C%22has_source%22%3Atrue%7D) and much more.
