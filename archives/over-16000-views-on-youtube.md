In the space of two weeks I have gone from having just 11,000 views on my [youtube channel](http://www.youtube.com/user/warzabidul) to over 16,000, thanks mostly to videos I shot with the phone. I went to film the Geneva Lake Parade and then the Paleo. The Lake Parade generated several thousand views and already I've had over four hundred views to the Paleo Manu Chao and Tiken Jah... can't remember the name. It's not bad and it demonstrates the trend that I think is interesting. Go out and film, put it online with the right keywords and watch as people flock to see the content that you have offered them. Of course this is just an experiment but it's increased my visibility quite a bit. I'll wait to see how long it takes to get to twenty thousand views and more. What are the next events I could cover in Switerland?
