As a frequent user of twitter following over 1000 people it's impossile for me to keep up with everything that's going on. That's especially true now that I'm going out more often, working and summer is here. As a result of these factors I removed anyone that doesn't @ me very often, doesn't remind me of a conversation or doesn't post much. As a result the signal to noise ratio has gone down and twitter should be more manageable. In total I removed about six hundred people this morning. Now to see how things change.
