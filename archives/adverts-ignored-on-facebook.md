_For one of his campaigns, out of 10,080 impressions there were only 8 clicks. The average cost-per-click for Fred was $0.08 and the average CPM was $0.06. This is a less than stellar performance._ ([source](http://www.allfacebook.com/2007/11/is-facebook-advertising-effective/)) Of course people don't click and there's a really good reason. They go to facebook to see what their friends are doing, what funny pictures of friends they can find and more. Facebook is and will remain a glorified phonebook. People aready want to move away because of all the zombie biters, vampires and many related pieces of rubbish. Keep it simple (stupid).
