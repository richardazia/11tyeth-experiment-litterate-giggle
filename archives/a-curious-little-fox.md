I enjoy to go on walks that last from one to two hours and to explore the area where I live. In doing so I see interesting wildlife. Just yesterday I came across a furry little fox. I didn't have my proper camera so I had to go home and get it. This is some of the footage I managed to get. He's cute isn't he?
