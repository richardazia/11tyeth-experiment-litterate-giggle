So which one did you get? I was in the Apple Store at Cherry Creek today , and one of the staff told me that they were out of them currently. They also have a reservation list of hundreds of people who are still wanting one. Local Big Box Electronic stores are in the same situation of not having enough iPads to meet the demand.

I got the 64 gig wifi and 3g version because that's the one that makes sense. So far it's been a great device although I have yet to really put it through it's paces. We'll see when that occurs.
