Great Post. I am still in two minds. Defining anonymous is the problem, I know you and the others - it's not about that really, it's those people that simply spread hate and use names that are never seen again. Maybe we should all have Open ID anon identities too!

Of course, if you're being harrased that's something different, at least by requiring an e-mail address you reduce the chances, and if you use disqus you can probably block them more easily.

But then again a french blogger friend of mine wrote a blog post about that topic yesterday. She addressed the issue of the person who was being targeted and how her life in a few years may be affected.  
  
Hate is something that we find everywhere though. It's just a matter of seeing whether there's any substance to the hate that's being spread or not. There are a few things we would all like to complain about but rather than be direct about them we try, through reasoning to demonstrate why another point of view might be more beneficial.
