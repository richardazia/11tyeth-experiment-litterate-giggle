My dissertation had been finished and ready to print since yesterday afternoon but it's today that i finally printed out the entire document for handing in to the university for assesment. it's 10,800 words for some of the most highly produced work I have ever done. It feels good to have handed it in and never to have to worry about it. Many of the others have handed in the work and it's going to be celebrated tomorrow although the prospect of spending my first real day of freedom hung over does not appeal to me therefore I'm planning on not drinking. Now what to do with all this time I've got. Find a place to live, find a place to work and more. Everything is there, absolute freedom to do anything at any time i want now.
