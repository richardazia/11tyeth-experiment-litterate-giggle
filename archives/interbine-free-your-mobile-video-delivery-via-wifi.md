[![](http://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/logo-interbine.gif "logo-interbine")](http://www.interbine.com) is an automated service that grabs videos from RSS feeds and converts them to 3gpp for easy download to the N95 and other mobile phones running the s60 OS. There are a number of default shows including [MobuzzTV](http://dailybuzz.mobuzz.tv/), Zefrank, [National Geographic](http://www.nationalgeographic.com/), [DiggNation](http://revision3.com/diggnation/), [Rocketboom](http://http//www.rocketboom.com/vlog/) and a number of other well known shows. In the right hand column you have another four methods of accessing content, searching, browsing according to keywords, highest rated or what's new. The second option is to browse through the directories they have selected to find the categories that are closest to your particular interests.

The final element is add a channel. If I wanted to I could take the RSS feed for the videos I have produced and create a channel to share with others with tags and more. The Personal feed is like a channel but for private use. The search feed works according to tags placed by other people in their videos. If you want video content about a music festival or event in a town by where you live then add those search terms and when video content appears it will be fed straight to your phone. Add youtube feed and video clip are self explanatory. The website does not limit itself to the feeds that they have selected. With their firefox extension you may go to the youtube content of your choice and create channels of your choice. They appear in your account on the Interbine website. **Over the AIR (OTA) deliver** Once all the shows you want have been selected and the interbine application is selected you have a number of methods for downloading content over the air (OTA). These are WIFI, via the phone carrier and bluetooth. The option I have tested most extensively is Wifi. Once you're in the application you have the option to sync all the video data you have selected and it will come to your phone for later viewing. Since this is a mobile device there are a number of settings that are relevant, especially if you choose to get data via the carrier. These are how much space to allocate on the phone, how much data transfer you want to allow per month and how long the data will stay on your phone. **The Player** The application has a built in player that allows you to view the content per channel and then per video, allows for resuming, and syncing of the media for viewing. So far though I have had one minor inconvenience. I can't get sound to work. I had the same problem with the youtube player so i don't mind. (Turns out that problem was due to the warnings being off on the sound profile. That has since been fixed and it works fine) The work around has been to use the media gallery, play the content once and delete it once viewed. **What I like** What I like about this service is that it makes video content retrieval and viewing a far smoother experience than before. It may take some time to set up but once everything set according to your preferences everything else is automatic. Once you get back from work you open the application, sync your content and the next morning as you commute you've got a choice of video content to watch.
