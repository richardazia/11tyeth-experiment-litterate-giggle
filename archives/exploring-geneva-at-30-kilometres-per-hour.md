Exploring Geneva at 30 kilometres per hour makes a nice change from driving in the city. Yesterday I met with the Geneva Bike and beer group. It's an activity from within the broader Geneva based Glocals activities. \[caption id="attachment\_2408" align="alignleft" width="169"\][![Exploring the Geneva landscape by bike](http://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P1030751-169x300.jpg)](http://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/P1030751.jpg) Exploring the Geneva landscape by bike\[/caption\] The pace is reasonable and the loop is about 20km for this second group ride. There are a lot of opportunities to cycle away from traffic and on quiet roads. It was fun for me to see the landscape differently. For over a year I used to drive in that landscape to get to dive sites and back. This time I was far lighter. As with everything in Geneva the group is international with people from a number of countries and continents. I will participate again.
