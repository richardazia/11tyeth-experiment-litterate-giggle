This weekend I went on a social media binge. A social media binge is the moment when you forfeit sleep and the rest of reality for a few hours as part of the social media. For the purpose of this particular challenge I set myself two pass times. The first of these was to twitter and the second was to seesmic. If you read previous posts you'll find out what twitter. As to seesmic that's another story. It's close to being instant messaging with videos. Normal video chats are live. I talk and as I talk you can respond and interrupt me. In seesmic you talk, type a title and share the video. After that another person speaks, presses stop and posts. Over the period of a few hours many more posts appear and as they do so the conversation evolves exponentially. All of these videos is available to every over member so there is a great degree of overheard conversation. This overheard conversation is where the fun begins. I've seen girls dancing, guys act like zombies, discussions about literature and social media. I've seen so many things that it feels like the social media equivalent of a music festival. Watch seesmix clips on youtube to get a better idea.
