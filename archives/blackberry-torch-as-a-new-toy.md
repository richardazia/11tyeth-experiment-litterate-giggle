Blackberry is the latest phone operating system I have played with. So far my impressions of the OS are not that favourable. In particular what confuses me is the inability to setup the mail client, twitter and facebook out of the box as I can do with symbian, android, iOS and one or two other mobile platforms. What I do like is that the battery is meant to last a long time. I have a virtual and physical keyboard and I quite like optical scrolling. Â¨ We will see how long it takes before I feel at home with this new operating system.
