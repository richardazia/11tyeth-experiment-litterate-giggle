[![15,000](http://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/15k.jpg)](http://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/15k.jpg "15,000") I was going to dedicate my 15,000th tweet to [Maggieconv](http://www.twitter.com/maggieconv), [AmandaGravel](http://www.twitter.com/amandagravel), [Starrgazr](http://www.twitter.com/starrgazr), [Shanzan](http://www.twitter.com/shanzan) and a few other twitter friends but [Shanzan](http://www.twitter.com/shanzan) won the price. She said goodnight and as a result my 15,000th tweet was dedicated to her. If you've got any questions about how to use twitter just let me know and I should be able to help. I've been spending enough time on the site to give recommendations on how to use it as well as to it's purpose.
