A few weeks ago I was completely opposed to Threads being connected and accepted by the Fediverse because I hated the idea of 100 million users flooding a social network with 10 million users. Now that threads has imploded I feel differently.

Now that Threads is the same size as the Frediverse, or at least closer to being the same size, the impact of the two joining up would be diminished. Now is the time when, theoretically, the impact of Threads and the Fediverse merging would be less dramatic.

## Still Unwanted

Although the Fediverse and Threads could merge, and be on equal footing, for now, I still don't want it. Facebook users have a different social media ethic than the Fediverse does. I don't want to see posts by utilitarians, rather than human beings. I want human connections, not marketers. 

## The Algorithm

Algorithms use machine learning to read posts, assess them, and decide how to share them. The Fediverse is about sharing, and re-sharing, in chronological order. How could Threads read toots, notes, articles and more, without breaching privacy rules?

For now the Fediverse behaves according to who we follow, and what the people we follow share. With algorithms machine learning would make those decisions, destroying the chronological order of things

The question is "how can Facebook adapt to be compatible with the Fediverse?". In theory it can't because we're talking about two different philosophies. One where chronology and follows are king, and the other where algorithms dictate what people see, feel and buy.

## A Different Age

Although I really liked the old Twitter, and social media landscape, when it was unprofitable, that reality has vanished and now we are in the age of Influencers, clickbait, social media as addiction, and more. That's why the thing that fascinates me the most now, is using WordPress and ClassicPress to play with the Fediverse. When they play nicely together I will be able to blog, and converse from my blog posts, without spending too much time in the Fediverse.

## And Finally

[Threads Posts get more likes for brands than on Twitter](https://www.yahoo.com/finance/news/threads-posts-receive-more-likes-125241351.html) which illustrates why Threads is not interesting for human beings. Social media, for me, is about sharing and caring, rather than utilitarian apathy. 

To summarise: Threads is a network for brands to market to people, whilst the Fedivere exists for people to converse, share, and collaborate. If the utilitarianism of Threads comes to the Fediverse, then the Fediverse will lose some of its allure.
