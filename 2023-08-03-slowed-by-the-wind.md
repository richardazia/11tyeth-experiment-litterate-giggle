Yesterday I walked into the wind for two to three kilometres. The wind was so strong that the Apple watch gave me "high noise level" warnings more than once. The wind was around 30-40km/h. It was so strong that I stopped listening to an Audiobook because I couldn't hear it. I then heard the summary for the last kilometre and was told that I was walking at 11 minutes per kilometre, compared to my 10 minutes 40 per kilometre.

I didn't ride the bike because I saw how windy it was, but for the wind to be strong enough to affect my walking speed is new. I've walked in very high winds in the past, but that was at the sea side, not Switzerland. Walking in a strong wind is unpleasant because it's noisy, So noisy that you can't listen to anything but the wind.

## Wind on a Bike

We are all familiar with the wind when cycling. We are used to that feeling of fighting an uphill battle despite being on flat ground. A few days ago I cycled to Geneva and back and I was fighting the wind. When you cycle into the wind you're making a certain amount of effort but your progress is sluggish. You question whether you are less fit than usual, and you feel more tired. The wind makes you work hard. That's why riding with the wind pushing is more fun. That's when you feel much faster than usual.

## Surprised

I was really surprised that the wind actually slowed me down but that's normal. I was walking into the wind, and there were no trees or other obstacles to break up the wind. I was walking headlong into the wind, with no trees or anything else to slow it down. I tried walking in the lee of a power pole but that didn't help. I just walked into the wind.

## Warm Day

I checked the temperature before going on my walk. I saw that the temperature was 27°c, so walking in that temperature, with that wind, is not unpleasant. I wasn't cold. I was simply impatient to get next to some trees and buildings, as well as to change direction, to stop facing straight into the wind. 

> According to the Beaufort scale, walking into the wind becomes difficult at around 32-38 kph (50-61 mph). This is the equivalent of a moderate gale. At this wind speed, the wind can start to push you back, making it difficult to maintain your balance and forward momentum. If the wind is blowing from the side, it can also make it difficult to walk in a straight line.

> At wind speeds of 40 kph or more, walking into the wind can become dangerous. The wind can be strong enough to knock you over, and it can also make it difficult to breathe. If you are planning on walking in windy conditions, it is important to dress appropriately and to be aware of the risks involved.

According to Google Bard I was right at the limit of what can be walked in, comfortably. Just a little stronger and I would have been fighting with the wind, rather than inconvenienced.

## And Finally

Overall this summer has been calmer than usual. We have had wind, rain and moderate heat. We have not had days in a row that reached 37°c or more. This summer has been more comfortable, less extreme.
