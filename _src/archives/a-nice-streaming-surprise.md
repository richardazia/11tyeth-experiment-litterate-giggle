The month is almost over and I've got fourty megabytes of streaming left to play with so I'm going to take advantage of that with my mobile phone. Since cities around Switzerland are covered by 3g you may find that I'm using Qik, Bambuser and Flixwagon to stream what I'm doing. Today I actually got Flixwagon to stream live over wifi which is better than i got yesterday and I found that streaming via qik works well on 3g. In less than a hundred days you'll have big crowds of people in the streets and that's going to be for the European cup. If enough bars and squares have wifi then you could get the fans streaming their reactions live from the pub. It's the Vertovian vision, the All Seeing eye, and it's a reality, no longer just a 1920's eutopian vision.
