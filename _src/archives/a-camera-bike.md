In Spain I keep seeing the BKL Prolimp bikes and I like them. They're tricycles rather than bikes but I think they could be useful. Instead of transporting a broadcast camera and tripod in a car or smart you could transport them on the back of this bike. Instead of a bin bag though I would have the tripod bag and find a way to fix the camera as well.

I don't like the price. These bikes are 3300 euros according to at least one site. I like these as a curiousity. It's nice to have transport like this for cleaning, rather than a pickup truck or small car. You're outdoors, riding a bike over small distances.

I saw a helmet being used as a parking brake so I don't know whether these bikes come with a parking brake or whether they have to be improvised.

I know this post is random. I am lacking inspiration.
