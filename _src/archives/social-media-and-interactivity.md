I have been studying and discussing media tech and society. I have also been listening to the podcasts from the SXSW event on interactivity and my view of technology and daily life has changed. That's reflected by what I was going to post as an answer to a comment on flickr. The iphone will sell because it's what people want. People have accounts on flickr, they're part of myspace and they're on facebook. There friends are as well. Recently I've been going out with a camera and taking up to 180 pictures in one night. I upload them to facebook, controlling who can see them and they're popular. People get round to requesting more pictures so I need to take more. With my mobile phone comes a one gig mini sd card therefore I can store thousands of pictures. I show people the pictures and if they want to see them online then at least I've got a practical way of getting people to approve them. What was SXSW about? Interactivity. Why? because social networking websites encourage the free sharing of all the media you're creating.
