Last night I went to central London to get some information about a possible shoot and edit for students at another university. If we get a camera then we can do something for tomorrow. 1p coins in student unions are dangerous. If one happens to fall in you're going to have to drink it. Touch the cup is another game I saw yesterday. It's a strange game because of it's aim, at least with last night's drink. Before going to sleep two students were outside the halls yelling and trying to get into the building. one of them kept yelling "where's my shoe", "I've lost my shoe". Sometimes you hear strange things
