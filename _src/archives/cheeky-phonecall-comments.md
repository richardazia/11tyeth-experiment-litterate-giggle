I have had a few calls from them recently and what I did was to store this number into the phone book with the name 'do not answer' and set the ringing tone from this number to 'silent'.

missed a call from this number (02920368792) and luckily checked online and found this message board and a blog saying don't answer. I've only ever had trouble with this sort of blood sucker!

I got a call from that number yesterday and another one today. Im revisin so i rejected both of them, and i searched it online to see if the owner was there and found this blog. I dont know how they even got my number.
