That's the hardest I've ever worked. starting the day at ten and continuing on till 2 am on an early night and four am last night. I spent 17 hours working on projects and now I'm exhausted. in the morning I had to finish the documentary, then have a meeting about multicam before once again working on the multicam. After those two pieces of work, there was the DVD authoring for both projects, the log files and finally the analysis. It's so much work but as a thank you I could walk around and enjoy that other people were still under pressure. I'm so happy I finished the work early in the day. It's current madness in the library and I need to sleep for a while. My Finale Year Project is Finished.
