Sock on the door
----------------

In US films a sock or other object on a door handle implies that there are two or more people enjoying bedroom sports. As a couple were in one room I took the opportunity of speaking about doing this joke and then doing it. It's harmless fun in an original context. How often do you see this in an air raid shelter?

Glass of water thrown onto a person taking a shower
---------------------------------------------------

I always want to throw cold water onto people taking a shower so I tried with my hands. I mentioned this idea to someone else and he grabbed a glass of water and threw it onto his girlfriend. I think she was slightly disappointed that it hadn't been me throwing the water.

Glass of water balanced on a door

Someone else liked the idea of glasses of water falling on people so he took a glass and placed it above the door and leaning. The intention was that when the next person opened the door it would soak them. As this was during a party it was normal behaviour.

Playing sounds through the ventilation shafts.
----------------------------------------------

When you're standing outside near one of the vents you can hear people speaking inside. It's fun to play tricks on people so I queried what we could do to scare or surprise the people downstairs. One person decided to play the sound of an emergency vehicle.

When a person came up to the surface he spoke of hearing a fire truck or other vehicle so the joke was a partial success.
