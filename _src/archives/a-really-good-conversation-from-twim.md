[This Week in Media 85](http://www.pixelcorps.tv/twim85) is an interesting conversation about media news for the past week with a technological slant. This week's interesting is particularly interesting as it explored the future of television and how people consume media. From the PVR and the ability for people to discuss the content they enjoy to machines that talk to each other they cover many topics. They also discussed computer literacy and whether the youth of today are as computer litterate as previous generations. That's an interesting point. The idea is not whether someone can get a computer to do what they want but rather whether they know how to set it up. Think of Linux. Would you be able to setup a linux box. It's the type of discussion that's good to follow to give you a number of points of view.
