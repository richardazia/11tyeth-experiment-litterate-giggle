Today I tried to unblock the ipod touch and it froze the first time and started to heat up and the second time the screen went to black. I thought on two occasions that my ipod was bricked. I've been able to re-install everything and am now syncing the content back onto the device. For the first attempt the device was plugged into the computer and whilst I did see the install app on the screen the display would stop responding. Whether this is due to weak wifi or an incompatibility I'm not sure. On the second attempt the hack didn't work and went so far as for the display to cease working. I tried re-starting it with the button and nothing changed. As I plugged it back into the laptop it detected that something was happening and so I was able to restore the ipod. In summary I'm not going to try that again with my own ipod. I'll wait until February when they'll allow third party apps to be included.
