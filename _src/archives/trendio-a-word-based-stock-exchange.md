I've just started playing with [Trendio](http://www.trendio.com/frontpage.php?language=en&ref_id=30296) which seems like an interesting website. In the past i've played on websites where you're playing the stockmarket with virtual money and you can see how you're doing without the risk of bankrupcy usually associated with investment. I've only been using it a few hours now and I have yet to make a profit on the search terms but over a short amount of chance there is a chance that I will make virtual credit. I'll come back to this topic once I have more experience of it.
