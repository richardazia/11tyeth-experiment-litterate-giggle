A few days ago I noticed that twitter was tweeting their programs as they were on in German and this looked like a good idea. I commented it was a shame that they didn't have the same in French. Within a few days it's there. This morning I saw [Arte's](http://twitter.com/ARTEtv_fr) [tweet](http://twitter.com/ARTEtv_fr/status/1120277490) for one program and so I'm watching a guy play some Chopin on the Piano. I spend quite a bit of time watching the twitter stream so if someone gives me their program details, as an opt in then there's a good chance that I will tune into the program on the spare of the moment. If I had intended to watch the program at 2038 in three days time I would have forgottten about it. As things are that's what's playing on the right side of my screen now.
