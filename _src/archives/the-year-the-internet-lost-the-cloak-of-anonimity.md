This has to be the year where I have met the most people online before meeting them in person, which is quite amusing. It's also the year that warzabidul as a nickname became a person in the physical world to more than two or three people. It's the year an online person become a nickname for a real person. It's the year where, at least for early adopters, [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com) and [Seesmic](http://www.seesmic.com) both helped create opportunities for people to meet and get to know each other online before taking it back into the physical world. It's the year I went to a Podcamp, some tweetups and some seesm'up. It's the year many of us stopped hiding behind avatars and nicknames and moved towards creating a brand or identity, depending on whether your point of view is that of marketing or personal fun. I've enjoyed learning about the "social media" and all the new possibilities. I look forward to 2008 when many more such networks and events will be organised. It's been a fun year to be introduced to the "Social Media" and I'm happy to have met so many people.
