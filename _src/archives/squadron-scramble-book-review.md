[Squadron Scramble](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1530888808/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1530888808&linkCode=as2&tag=mainvision-20&linkId=9bb39dae798dd285544479e5f114be5d)![](//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=mainvision-20&l=am2&o=1&a=1530888808)Â is an interesting book to read in post-BREXIT England because it highlights aspects of the Second World War that BREXITers forget about. It looks at how the main character had to flee France via Dunkirk as well as the situation that Polish airmen had found themselves in. First they lost their homes, then they had to flee France when it was invaded and finally they went to England via North Africa. You can read more about [Polish Air Forces in France and Great Britain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_Air_Forces_in_France_and_Great_Britain) following this link for factual rather than fictional information and context.Â The book provides us with an easy to read, easy to understand scenario. If you had lost your country and you were flying for a third country would you want to shoot pilots as they parachute to safety or would you allow them to live.  If you were in England during the Second World War at what point would you have felt secure and confident that Germany would be overwhelmed and beaten. When would the battle shift from a fight for survival to a fight for supremacy? This book focuses on the air war during daylight hours when Hurricanes and Spitfires were in their element and only glimpses at dog fighting at night.Â The book touches superficially on a number of topics without providingÂ as much depth and context as it could.  This is an interesting documentary about the Polish contribution to the Battle of Britain. It shows how effectively they helped to fight the German Luftwaffe and how they were betrayed by the British people once the war was over. They had fought to defend England and defeat the Germans in order to ensure that their country would be freed from the Germans only to be betrayed when their country was handed over to the communists. Some of them went back to Poland but had to flee to other countries. They were not honoured in the victory parade either. The documentary is interesting as it provides its viewers with a good account of the Polish contribution to the British and Allied war effort.
