Garmin allows you to select the number of steps you want to take in a single day, or let it be set automatically. For a year or two I allowed the goal to set. The result is a step goal that fluctuated from 12,000 steps per day to 15,000 steps or more. This was fine, because I ignored it.

A few days ago I decided to set it to a fixed ten thousand steps a day. Many will say that the 10,000 steps per day doesn't matter, and I agree. I took 21,000 steps today so I overshot the mark by a little.

I run every two days or so, and I walk for an hour and a half or more each day. Although I do this sometimes I undershoot the goal by a few hundred steps and the streak is lost. The streak, too, doesn't matter, because it is meaningless. What I find interesting is the number of steps taken in a year. Once it was five and a half million. Now it is currently about 4.3 million.

These numbers too, don't matter. If you run, or if you cycle you're either making more effort, or your steps are not counted. In both cases the step count tells one story but other metrics tell another.

Last night I read about how you can increase your Vo2 max up to a certain point, and after that it doesn't increase. What does change is your resistance to fatigue. You go from being able to run for 2 kilometres to being able to run for 2.3 kilometres, and more.

Today I walked for two hours in drizzle. I passed by two Camino stamp opportunities and collected them in a booklet that is not designed for this use. I collected them as a curiousity, and to give this walk a different purpose.
