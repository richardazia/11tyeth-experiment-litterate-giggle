When you're the producer one of the first things you do is make sure that the person you're meant to be filming is at the location where you want him at the time you would like him to be there. A few days ago though, when someone else was producing the talents did not show up and we waited five hours for no reason. This was frustrating since i had at least two other things I could have been doing instead. Today I have another more spontaneous vox pop gathering excercise around central London and probably Camden. I'm not sure about the best location but we should see this within a short amount of time. I've been thinking more about the topic of my dissertation and the research queston and whilst reading Documentary In the digital Age I think I may have found an essay question. I have to fine tune it to be neither to focused nor too broad.
