For years now I have been tracking my sports activities with sports tracker on a variety of mobile phones, dive computers and sports tracking watches. I have gone canyoning, hiking, swimming, skiing, snowboarding, climbing, to do via ferrata, explored caves and trained indoors. In that time I have not had too many injuries and I have taken hundreds, if not thousands of photographs. \[caption id="attachment\_2809" align="aligncenter" width="300"\][![1000hrs with sports tracker](http://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-04-at-17.26.30-300x241.png)](http://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Screen-Shot-2016-04-04-at-17.26.30.png) I have tracked more than 1000 hours\[/caption\] These activities have been in France, Spain, Switzerland, Italy, England, Poland and maybe in or two countries that I have forgotten about. Sports tracking has progressed enormously since I started tracking activities. In the beginning I was using the N95 8gb and the battery lasted for about an hour. I then switched to various iphones and android devices before deciding that mobile phones were crap. That's when I moved over to the Suunto Ambit 2 and later Suunto Ambit 3 devices. Since then I have been very happy tracking my physical activities. One key step was when Suunto and Sports tracker decided to share data between their services. At this moment I could track with the Suunto Ambit 3 and share to Sports tracker without four or six steps per activity. Since then the service has been reliable.
