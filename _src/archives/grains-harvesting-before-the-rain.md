Grains in a hand, found on the road.

According to my watch, and farmers, a storm is coming. Thatâ€™s why they are busy trying to harvest all the grain before it hits.

At this time of year you can watch the combine harvesters harvesting all the fields and collecting grain. You can then see tractors following up and gathering what they leave on the fields and making plenty of bails.

I can't focus so I'm cutting this post short.
