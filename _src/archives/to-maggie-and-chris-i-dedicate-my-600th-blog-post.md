To [Maggie](http://twitter.com/maggieconv) and [Chris](http://twitter.com/cwardzala) I dedicate this, my 600th blog post as you are now in Florida, engaged and planning the rest of your life [together.](http://twitter.com/teammagris) We have exchanged hundreds of messages over the past year and it's been fun. Now the dynamics have progressed and in so doing why not mark the occasion :-) Have fun. As a sub note I also dedicate it to my Cousin and his fiancÃ©e. And to [Seesmic Whit](http://twitter.com/whitscott) and Claire.
