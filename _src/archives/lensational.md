From Friday to Sunday this week [SIGEF2015](https://www.sigef2015.com/) took place at the Batiment des Forces Motrices in Geneva Switzerland. This event was organised by [Horyou](https://www.horyou.com/), a social network for social good, where people were connecting and networking, discussing how best to help people with various projects around the world. Living in the Western World we hear and see selfies of friends and many images of food, autumn and things they find appealing to look at. [Lensational](http://lensational.org/) is a project to bring photographic equipment and photography skills to people around the world. They recycle cameras, resell cameras, conduct photography training and sell photographs. They are looking for camera donations from both private individuals and corporations so that they can resell these cameras at an affordable price to those who would otherwise not have access to digital cameras. Women are then taught by NGOs and photographers about photography and this is seen as a means by which to empower women. Some of these images are then sold internationally to provide these women with additional income from stock photographs. [Photographs by Marginalised Women.](http://photos.lensational.org/?#!/index) Photography is a pleasant and enjoyable way of understanding daily life. It provides us with moments or instants from people's lives. In these images we can see how people live and how they have fun. It is a window in to their world and now that technology makes it possible sharing our day to day lives has become easy. We no longer require National Geographic, GEO and other publications to show us how other cultures live. We can now gain access directly with these people. It also gives marginalisedÂ womenÂ an opportunity to represent themselves.
