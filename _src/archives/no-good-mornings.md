Yet again Twitter is down for far longer than anticipated due to yet another server upgrade and I wonder about something. I can I recommend anyone use a service like twitter when it's got such a poort uptime record. It's not that complicated when you think of it as instant messaging so why all the downtime. I can't help but feel there's poor managment. I miss saying Good Morning to my World Wide audience.
