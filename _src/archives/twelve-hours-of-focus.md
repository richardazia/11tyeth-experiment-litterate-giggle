Today I drove for twelve hours with hardly any breaks and finished two books. Twilight of Democracy and Almost Human.

These were good books to read during a drive because they are both entertaining and informative. They are also well read. I think my day of rest yesterday helped too.

12 hrs, three countries, 1200+kilometres and I felt comfortable almost the entire time. I did see a scene in a cafe that reminded me that I am tired of solitude, but pandemics are not a good time to break out of solitude.

If the drive felt like this more often then I would make the trip more often. This is how I expect a long drive to feel.
