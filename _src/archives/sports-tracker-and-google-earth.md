Six thousand steps later and I've created yet another track via the Sports tracker application for the N95. What's fun is that within a few seconds of arriving home I can bluetooth the [KML file](http://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/cuve-2.kml) to my laptop, open it in google earth and I've got an arerial view of the wintery walk I took

[![The walk I did earlier](http://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/walk-300x294.jpg "walk")](http://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/walk.jpg)

If I could get a wintery map then it'd be perfect as the ground is covered in snow.

Update: I tested the "upload to service" and that's interesting too. All the tracks are stored there and you can upload images and more. If you know a few people using the service you can compare your tracks with them. Failing that you can share with the world and see what they've added.
