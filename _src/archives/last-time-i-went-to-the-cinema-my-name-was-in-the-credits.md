Last time I went to the cinema I was in Paris and my name was in the credits. This time I was at the 20th Century Fox offices on Soho Square in London as a guest, along with [Loudmouthman](http://www.twitter.com/loudmouthman), [Suzymiller](http://twitter.com/SuzyMiller), [Danacea](http://twitter.com/danacea), [Rupert Howe](http://twitter.com/ruperthowe), [Sizemore](http://twitter.com/sizemore) and many other social media participants. We were invited to preview the film [Juno](http://www.foxsearchlight.com/juno/), which will be out in British cinemas around the 8th of February 2008. It's nice to be two months ahead of the crowd. It's also nice to be in a private cinema. I enjoyed the leather seats along with the press package and the fact that when you lean back the seat tilts back at the same time. It was also amusing to see all these faces. It's a funny thing to be part of the social media mainly because you recognise and feel that people are familiar although you've never met them in real life. What makes this particularly appealing is the fact that it's not someone saying "oh I've heard something about you". They've actually looked at, and appreciated your work, or at least we hope so. I enjoyed the film and so did the rest of the crowd. Frequent laughter could be heard from around the room quite frequently. I did enjoy quite a bit of the dialogue and the story is a nice one although the end is typical of American films. Aside from the film and the crowds we did get to interview the organisers of the event as well as Danacea of Forbidden planet, Rupert Howe, vlogger and Robert... whose last name eludes me. It's 1am and I'm tired. The Twittervox video should be up by tomorrow evening at the latest. More concise information on those interviewed will of course, appear accordingly
