Twitter is obviously never going to sort out it's issues so from midnight today I will no longer be using the service during a month. I'll be using all the other sites, just don't feel like having my time wasted by twitter anymore. For all friends just continue interacting via all the services that have a 99.9% uptime rather than 3% downtime. See you then.
