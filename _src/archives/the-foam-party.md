Last night I went to the SU foam party but I was so tired that I only stayed till 2 am. It lasted till three am but the energy levels felt wrong. For all those people who are in the same year, this marks our final week of studies. we have nothing left but deadlines before we become graduates of our chosen fields of study. The real world awaits us with many interesting events Video is a discipline that requires a lot of work and a big team therefore the more people you can involve the better it goes. For two years I went to almost every single event to film and I got hours of footage which would be edited later for the SU tv. This year everything went downhill, from having a student magazine to a student newspaper, from having a cameraman to having a photographer.
