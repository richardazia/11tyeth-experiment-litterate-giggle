After two years of online interactions I finally met certain Geneva twitter users. The tweetup took place at the Bristol Hotel in Geneva. There was a good group of people and they were what you would exepect from a tweetup. It was organised by [bristolgva](http://twitter.com/#!/bristolgva) and [here](http://twitter.com/#!/search?q=%23TwittApÃ©ro) is some of the related twitter conversation linked to the event.
