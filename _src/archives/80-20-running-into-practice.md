I have been putting the [80/20 running rule](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20821042-80-20-running) into practice. The principal is simple. Instead of running to your max you run at a comfortable pace for most of your running instead. Instead of pushing yourself to be fast, you push yourself to have endurance. You train at a pace that is 80 percent or less of your maximum, to perform better when you race.

Train for Endurance, Not Speed
------------------------------

The concept is rational. You could train to your max but by doing so you tire yourself emotionally, physically and mentally. Instead of improving you hit a wall. The 80 percent rule builds on the idea that by training consistently at a lower intensity 80 percent of the time you build stamina and endurance.

With the Garmin program by Greg I find myself having to slow down, rather than speed up. I find that I need to run at a pace that is easy, rather than strenuous. With other coaches they say "do 150-200 steps for 30 seconds, then do glides etc." Others say "Run this distance" and "Now run that distance".

I prefer the coaching I have now. "Run at this pace for that duration" It isn't about distance, and it isn't about duration so much as it is about pace. I have to consciously tell myself to slow down, to take it easy. It isn't that far from running pace. I know I can run faster. I need the discipline to slow down.

I am avoiding speed because I want to keep my knees from hurting. I want to strengthen them gradually, by training at a lower intensity, to give them the time to adapt and toughen up. This isn't about speed. This is about being able to run sustainably for longer distances, without discomfort. Today I felt that I am getting to that goal. I felt that I could run for longer.

A Dog Chase
-----------

I actually stopped running because a dog, that was not kept on a lead, showed interest in me, and then charged me. I left the road and it followed, so I stopped in a field. For an instant I was convinced that I would be bitten today. It felt that way. I thought it had finally happened again.

Normally I would avoid a car, especially one that stops there, because usually dogs jump out and tend to charge. I didn't turn around and change route. My habit of turning around and choosing another route, is justified after what happened. I hate that I keep being attacked. No, the dog didn't bite me, but it did run after me. Dogs do that. That's why I walked with hiking sticks before. That's why on one route I picked up a big branch.

Dogs scare me. They threaten me several times a year. If I had continued running it would have bit me. I had to stop, so that it would stop. I am tired of overcoming my fear of dogs on every walk. I am even more tired of having my fears confirmed by these attacks, several times a day. I class a dog that threatens or runs after me as an attack.

Next time I will walk the other way. I will not walk towards a car that is stopping. Once again my fear is justified.
