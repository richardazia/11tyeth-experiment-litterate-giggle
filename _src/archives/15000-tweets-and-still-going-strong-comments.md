This accomplishment begs for a new type of institution to house it in but you are so deliciously un-institutional that I will simply say "Hurray!"

Congrats on 15,000 tweets! I'm flattered that I was one of the contenders for the dedication. Maybe you can dedicate your 30,000th tweet to me :D Well done, Richard!

Wow, I just found this. Thanks for thinking of me and sorry I'm getting here so late. I hope things are going well for you. I'm sure you are way past this number and more by now. :)
