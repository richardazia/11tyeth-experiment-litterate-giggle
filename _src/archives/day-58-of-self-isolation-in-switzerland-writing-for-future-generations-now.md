I'm writing for future generations now. As I looked at the stats for the most recent posts i see that readership is low. I'm tempted to start writing about something else as a result. In two or three weeks if we're still seeing low numbers of new cases I might.

The biggest change since two days ago is that when I went to the shops I saw that InterDiscount and other places are open. Restaurants are open too. I saw some people in these places but without counting.

Inspiration to write usually comes from meeting people and having conversations but it's at least 58 days since I met someone new and had a different conversation so it's hard to explore new ideas.

The CSS front page I've been working on for the past three or four days is almost ready to be shared. I still need to tweak three or four things. I'm happy about this. When I replaced the time I spent on social media with playing with CSS I gave myself a great opportunity to learn two or three new skills. I was afraid that I would be confused and lost but so far I've found the opposite to be true. I've found it relatively easy.

The biggest challenge is getting the content to be desktop and mobile-friendly so every experiment I run has to look good on both. So far this has been a good experience. It's something that I haven't done, possibly since social media came along, and distracted us. It's a shame that social media didn't grow in quality of conversations but it has benefited my drive to learn something new.

We have to keep upskilling, and upskilling by working on a website is good, because we learn skills that others can see and assess within seconds. The more time I spend tweaking the first page the better it will look, and the more knowledge I will come away with.

See you tomorrow for day 59. We're just two days away from two months without being within two meters of another person.
