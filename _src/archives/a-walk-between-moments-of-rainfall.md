Today I woke early, shopped, studied German, read the news and then studied WordPress Child themes. It rained on and off, and I took a break from studying to go for a walk and I stayed dry almost the entire time. I carried a [Sea to Summit three litre bag](https://www.galaxus.ch/de/s3/producttype/wassersack-2235?tagIds=211-344-1198&bra=10977) with me, in case I needed to keep the phone etc dry. For a moment I thought it would start raining but it didn't so I stayed dry.

The walk was short, just one hour, as the conditions are not ideal for walking. The views weren't good and the probability of being caught in the rain was high. I also wanted to walk a route where I did not soak myself and my shoes. On the route I walked, cars were unable to bully me like they do on other routes.

The course I am studying now is [WordPress Building Child Themes](https://www.linkedin.com/learning-login/share?forceAccount=false&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Flearning%2Fwordpress-building-child-themes-3%3Ftrk%3Dshare_ent_url%26shareId%3D0STZAbDnRvSPcjoqGW5K9Q%253D%253D) and so far I find the course interesting. I have only gone so far as to create a child theme and ensure that it works. That's when I took a break for the daily walk. I enjoy studying JavaScript, Angular and other ideas but there is a lot to learn, so I thought that by returning to WordPress. I could focus on learning how to use functions, and understand concepts individually, and then return to Angular, JavaScript and more. I want to step my learning. I don't want to simply finish a course. I want to understand a concept first, and then finish the course.

I still have a lot to learn about CSS but at least this is a technology where I understand the ideas, even if I have not played with all of the tools, or learned of plenty of solutions yet. That is the point of step learning. You learn, get comfortable, and move on. I can also learn what I learn now, to move my entire website into a CMS with different sections having a different look. I have aspirations, and they will force me to learn how to implement them in WordPress.

I will spend more time studying, now.
