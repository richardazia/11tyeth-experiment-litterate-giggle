A rusty cow bell bell

Tomorrow I will be driving for twelve hours and I hope that I find it as relaxing as the last drive but I doubt that I will be that lucky. We will see how traffic and other conditions are.

I hope that I have a good two or three audiobooks to listen to, so that I may be entertained and focused. We will see.
