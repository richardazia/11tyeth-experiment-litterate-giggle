One treat of being in Spain is that some people do wear masks when walking outdoors. You are normal for wearing a mask.

In Switzerland you are looked at as if you are eccentric or absurd. It is nice not to be looked at as a curiousity. It is nice to have the security of a mask without feeling like a freak.

A paradox of mask wearing in Spain is that itâ€™s hot. In theory this would make it less appealing to wear a mask but it has no effect. People still want to be safe.
