Swordfish, the story of a bank robbery. It's a very interesting film because of the time period at which it was released. starring John Travolta

[Training Day](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005JKED/perspectives)

Starring Denzel Washington as a seasoned police officer in charge of training Ethan Hawke into the narcotics division of the police. With unorthodox habits ethics must be taken seriously again. 

[Fight Club](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00003W8NM/perspectives)

Fight club is about Tyler Durdan, a person whom is interested in one thing, violence. As time progresses what was at first a tiny club becomes a huge organization of crime. The development of the film is very interesting. Camera work, editing and the narration all contribute to make this a compelling piece of film making, easily a cult film.

[The Matrix](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00000K19E/perspectives)

For all those who thought about where reality and virtual reality merge watch this cult film. Keannu reaves stars as Neo whom needs to help overthrow the computer generated world in which we are now living. A powerful piece of film making although there is unexplored potential in so far as the Internet and WWW are concerned.

During the American civil war the English were trying to keep their colonies but certain men were more unruly than others.

When his son is shot he decides that something must be done about the English and engages a militia force to defeat the English. 

[Dog Soldiers](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00006L91H/perspectives)

Shot in the United Kingdom on a small budget over a period of a few months this film is a master piece in it's own right. The plot is well developed and the characters are quite good. It's nice to see this genre of film carried out in England. It will be available in November.

[Remember the Titans](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000056VP4/perspectives)

A very interesting piece of film making history.
