I asked a friend how to get the invite so I'm not sure how to do it but when I find out I'll let you know.

Richard, you'll have to tell me how to join Phreadz. It's quite Mission:Impossible ! Do you have invites ? Am i not francofou enough? Too young to know how to fly?

That's what migration is, fly south for the winter, fly back north for the summer :-)
