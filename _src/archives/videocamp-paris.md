A few days ago I was in Paris to meet the Francofous and in the process I passed by La Cantine where they were holding a Videocamp. It's like a barcamp but rather than talking about radio and podcastng people talked about peer to peer video sharing, citizen journalism and other topics. I filmed a few people presenting what their seminars had been about and finally they're available via my website. Please note that the videos are in French. [Video 1](http://www.main-vision.com/richard/video/paris0408/just got to work014.mp4) [Video 2](http://www.main-vision.com/richard/video/paris0408/just got to work015.mp4) And yes it is very lazy of me to distribute the videos like this but I don't have time to edit the content at the moment. If anyone wants to offer a transcript of what's said I'll credit you for the work.
