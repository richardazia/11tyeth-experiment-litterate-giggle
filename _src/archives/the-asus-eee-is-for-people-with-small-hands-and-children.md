Today I went over to try the ASUS EEE and it's too small. Its got the feel of a child's toy more than anything else. I'm a touch typist, I don't look at the keyboard when I'm typing, I appreciate feminine beauty as it walks past me in the computer room. I look around and the content keeps appearing on the screen. What this means is that getting used to such a small keyboard would take quite a bit of time. I prefer a thumb typing device. That doesn't mean I don't like the idea. I love small devices that I can take with me. That's why my coat weighs so much.
