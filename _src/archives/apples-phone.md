It's a nice screen, it's a laptop replacement similar to the phone I've had for two or three months but the hard drive is much better. He advertised all these features as new yet I've got most of those capabilities already so I'm laughing slightly. I was just two months ahead of that particular market. I'm wondering about wifi access. How easy is it to connect to password-protected networks and how strong is the antenna?. Would it work only on open networks? I like the screen but where's the keyboard for fast texting? How easily will it scratch? I know at least one person that's going to be looking forward to the PVR with integrated wifi although I don't find it interesting because the hard drive is too small at the moment. The fact you can stream from five computers at once is nice.
