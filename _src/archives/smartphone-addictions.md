It's amusing that people think of "kicking smartphone addictions". We now have a decade of experience in the current social media landscape. We have a decade of using smartphones rather than feature phones. In effect we have had a decade to adapt our lives to the age of the ubiquitous smartphone. We can ignore the Blackberry and Nokia ages where phones were for phone calls, playing snake and business rather than pleasure. \[caption id="attachment\_3418" align="aligncenter" width="300"\][![Those that see social media as a disease usually have partners. ](http://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-Shot-2017-03-09-at-14.28.20-300x98.png)](http://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Screen-Shot-2017-03-09-at-14.28.20.png) Those that see social media as a disease usually have partners.\[/caption\] People who see smartphones or social media as addictive usually have one thing in common. They have a "partner". They spend their free time with a specific individual. "Itâ€™s about finding balance. I became conscious of what matters to me, in my life. My smartphone is still a part of it, but itâ€™s no longer the boss." I have never been addicted to the device as such. My passions lie with what I can do with the device. I was passionate about Twitter when it was a social network. I was passionate about facebook when it was a way of keeping up with friends. If Twitter and facebook become ego-networks for marketers and public relations professionals then the "addictive" aspect of smartphones vanishes. As social media goes from a conversation to a broadcast and a monologue it delivers another opportunity. It gives us the chance to go back to reading books. As we no longer "socialise" with smartphones the "addiction" is gone. We loose nothing by spending time "offline". You don't need to give up the smartphone or any apps. If you're like me you can pick up an e-book reader and replace Facebook and twitterÂ with reading. If you're going to passively readÂ an e-book reader is an interesting alternative.
