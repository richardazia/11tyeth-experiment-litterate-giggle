Yesterday someone twittered about [tweetgrid](http://tweetgrid.com/), a simple to use web interface that allows you to see, in real time what people are tweeting about. It filters as many key words to chose and dedicates one portion of the screen per word. If you select four words then you can watch as four topics are discussed. if you select just two then you see only two. The reason this is a useful tool is that it makes trend watching easier. Imagine the new year's celebration. You could watch as a few people speak about what they're doing, as they wish you a happy new year. The point of tweetgrid is that it's a quick, easy to use interface that you can use from any computer.
