I can't focus when I am not in my usual writing spot, so I am not bothering. I finally get to enjoy a few hours of rain after long periods without. I still want to see rain in Switzerland but for that I need to be in Switzerland. I also have nothing to write because I didn't spend time in thought, or do anything noteworthy.
