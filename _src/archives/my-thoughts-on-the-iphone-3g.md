Today I played with the Iphone 3g and was left indifferent. That's because aside from having the same design as both the ipod touch and the 1st generation iphones it doesn't offer anything innovative. What really interests me is the idea of more data. Last month i did quite a bit of data streaming. 100 megabytes inclusive of my current setup. I also used quite a bit of extra data. With the Iphone 3g Plan I'd get 1 gigabyte of data per month, ten times more at relatively little extra. When I can get the Natel Liberty Grande paired with the Nokia N95 then I'll be happy. Until then I'll feel that they could do better.
