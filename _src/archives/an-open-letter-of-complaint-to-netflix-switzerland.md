Dear deceptive content distributors, When I have wanted to watch a number of documentaries the subtitles have been in German on english commentary documentaries. As a paying customer I expect English language versions to have English titles, English subtitles and English location information. If you do nothing to resolve this problem I will stop paying monthly for your content as you are not delivering what I am paying for. Do not cut corners. Be professional.
