Google thinks it's a bee. That's why they have the new service google buzz. I spent some time looking at it and it makes me think of jaiku, friendfeed and other services all combined into one. It's threaded conversations and status messages based on geo-tagged conversation triggers. It has a good interface with google reader and of course the question which I cannot answer yet is what does the full version have to offer that will enhance the user's experience
