Gravity is a twitter client for the s60 and I recently installed it on my N95 and so far I'm very happy with it. With an intuitive interface it makes being logged in to two twitter accounts and one identica account very easy. What is especially nice is that you select which account you want to look at and by scrolling left and right you see the friend's timeline, the replies, your tweets, your DM and finally searches if you want. That's automatic and for every account. It's far better than the other twitter clients for s60 that I've tried so for the moment that is one twitter client I would recommend you use. I know what I'm talking about. I tweet from anywhere without it slowing down my social life. Also if you pay for this app after the ten day trial period you're helping demonstrate that it's not just the iphone which has people willing to pay for the applications
