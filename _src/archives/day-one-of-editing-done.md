Day one of editing has finished and I've spent the last two hours resting and relaxing. The editing is quite interesting. We've got an interview with someone who was considered as hottest single in the world two or three weeks ago. The documentary is about myspace and it's effect on the music industry. It's interesting because we have at least ten interviews, that's ten points of view, some musical, others more ITish and yet more from the ordinary public. Three segments have been assembled and we have a few more to work on. The duration is only five minutes so far but will progress tomorrow. The rough cut needs to be done by thursday to give an additional week for gathering extra shots and cleaning everything up. I need to make time for the editing of the multicamera project.
