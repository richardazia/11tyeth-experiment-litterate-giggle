Pokemon Go has been available in Switzerland officially since yesterday but people have been playing the game for longer than this. Some have achieved level 20 and above. There is a vibrant Swiss Pokemon Go community in the French speaking part of Switzerland. [Pokemon Go Switzerland](https://www.facebook.com/Pokemongosuisse/?fref=ts)Â is one place where French speaking players can unite. One thousand nine hundred people have already liked the page so if you are looking for other players this is a good place to start. There is the [Pokemon Go Lausanne](https://www.facebook.com/groups/282004318826738/) group. This group has 430+ members at the time of writing. Friday they had their first [event](https://www.facebook.com/events/1729693773965600/)Â and at least elevent people were present. Another event is coming up on the [24th of July 2016](https://www.facebook.com/events/249871988731879/). 2850 people have liked the [Pokemon Go GenÃ¨ve page](https://www.facebook.com/pokemongogeneve/). Ingress players from Lausanne, Geneva and other french speaking towns have had a Google Hangout dedicated to Pokemon Go for several months. At this moment there are 83 members.Â 50 members of the Yellow Instinct faction are also highly active on Telegram. Hundreds of messages are exchanged. These communities form online to facilitate meeting other players offline in the physical world. By playing the game there is a good chance that you will come across other players, as would frequently happen with Ingress. Having online communities allows people to plan events and meetings, shares hints and tips and more. Factions can plan a campaign, come to my village and lets capture it from this faction or that faction. Come to that train station or event and you will find these pokemons. The game is creating new social groups and the age range according to one thread I saw today is between 15 years old and 45. I am certain that all age groups are playing. That is the range people disclosed in that specific thread. I expect the community to grow and for events to be organised on a regular basis. If you do play the game then there are hundreds of people to meet and play alongside in the LÃ©man region of Switzerland.
