Today I went exploring the French Jura in the hope of capturing some of the Autumnal colours. I drove an hour into the Jura and arrived at [this place](http://www.jura-tourism.com/cascades/les-cascades-et-gorges-de-la-langouette,r351,ot143.html). They say that it's a one hour walk but it took me less than that to cover. There is information along the path for children to learn about features of Gorges and how they're formed. What I found more interesting was a sign for the [Tram Jurasienne](http://www.tramjurassienne.com/) railway line. In June there is a race along the path where the railway line once passed. Like Julia Bradbury in her British Railway walks I walked over a viaduct and along some lines until I arrived at a tunnel. I enjoyed that documentary series and as a result I would like to follow the line further. It will require some research. So far I see that it was the first Jurassic tram. I also know that the race with the same name is 29 km long. What I don't know is where it starts and where it ends. I also don't know how much of the path is walkable. That is part of the time.
