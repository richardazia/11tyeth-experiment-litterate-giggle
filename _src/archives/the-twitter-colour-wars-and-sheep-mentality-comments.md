I did not know it was a colour war, I just noticed I am followed by Aqua whatever, and then I followed back. Thanks for clearing it, I was totally clueless about the whole thing.

I joined my team of choice of a humorous whim - it was under my nose when I logged in and it appealed to my sense of whimsy. Then the socio-political rumblings started and certain people were using their colours as an excuse to snipe... and I wasn't the only one who felt that way. If we're REALLY building something here, then let's be bigger people, shall we? Nice one :)
