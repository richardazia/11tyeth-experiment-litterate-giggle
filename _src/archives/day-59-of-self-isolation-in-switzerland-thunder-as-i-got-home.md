For once I walked in the drizzle, rather than the rain but I could hear thunder as I got home. I have almost reading [Thirst: 2600 Miles to Home](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07MXNHSLY/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=B07MXNHSLY&linkCode=as2&tag=richardsblo09-21&linkId=a97c718019c06394dacb3e02fd0fdad2) during this walk. Poetically I was listening to her about walking with a storm on its way whilst a storm was thundering over the Jura.

The rain became heavy just as I got close to home so today I am not drenched to the bone, and in need of a change of clothes like yesterday. I started today's walk by running for the first two and a half kilometres, using the Guardian's running podcast week three, for the fourth time. I didn't run last week and I prefer to give my legs time to acclimate to running before pushing too much.

I spent most of my waking hours today working on the website. I'm still working on the front page and I think it's almost ready to go live. It's built with CSS, a little javascript, and grids. I have it behaving as I want it to behave. It looks good, whether viewed on a "desktop" or a mobile phone.

What I learned while working on the front page has helped. When I was making web pages mobile-friendly a week or two ago was bare bones and I didn't change much. Now when I re-worked three or four pages today I used CSS where I could. I replaced tables with CSS and with pages where I had lists I used CSS to enhance lists. There is one page I still need to re-work, but I need to think about how to do something interesting.

See you tomorrow.
