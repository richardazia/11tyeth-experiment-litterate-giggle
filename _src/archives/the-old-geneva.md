Now it's a mass of buildings and the relief is hidden. \[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="500" caption="Geneva many years ago"\][![Geneva many years ago](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3230/3098063137_e3f7f2c247.jpg "Lile Rousseau")](http://www.flickr.com/photos/18643384@N08/3098063137/)\[/caption\] ![Then](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3289/2736584616_097f188a27.jpg?v=0) Then ![and Now](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3030/2934155603_15c2440878.jpg?v=0) Such a contrast between the two.
