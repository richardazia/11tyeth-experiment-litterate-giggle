This is a simple Iphone, Android and other platform solution which allows you to add your foursquare, gowalla, brightkyte and other accounts to checkin. The idea is simple. You have one interface where you see everything your friends are up to. You have a second interface where you can check in to locations several at a time. It will save time and battery life to use just one application.
