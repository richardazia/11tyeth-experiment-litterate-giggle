The Golden Dream, known in Spanish as The Golden Cage is an observational film that follows three teenagers as they travel to Guatemala along railroad tracks north towards the United States. During the journey they need to work to make money, face attacks from the police, immigration police and gangs. When one of the characters finally arrives in the US he works cleaning a slaughterhouse after the workers have finished their shift. Trump supporters and Brexit voters need to watch these films because the trip from economically less developed countries to economically more developed countries is not an easy one. It requires the taking of risks. In this context they face organised crime, heat and other challenges. I watched this film at the [Graduate Institute yesterday night](http://graduateinstitute.ch/events/_/events/corporate/2016/the-golden-dream). It was shown within the context of the [Global Migration Film Festival](https://social.shorthand.com/UNmigration/32JUgzeJ66/5-to-18-december). During the discussion at the end of the screening the panel spoke about some of the other challenges that people face such as human trafficers and more. Two aspects we do not see are the injuries that people sustain falling off of trains and rape is alluded to rather than shown. [The Invisible City \[Kakuma\] - Trailer (ENG) - Lieven Corthouts](https://vimeo.com/164064320) from [Cassette for timescapes](https://vimeo.com/cassettefortimescapes) on [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com). People need to watch these documentaries and films. Awareness of these issues needs to be endemic to the Western World. Yesterday they said something to the effect that "This is not a crisis, this is a norm." They said that because this was a situation that has been going on for decades changes need to be made. Permanent solutions need to be found to improve the lives for all of those that are affected. It is a shame that rather than see a growth in compassion and cooperation we are seeing people like Trump elected and ideas like Brexit adopted. The trend needs to be reversed and that is where documentaries and films can help open peoples' eyes. Society needs to move away from populism and fast. \[caption id="attachment\_3391" align="aligncenter" width="200"\][![The Global Migration Film Festival](http://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/original-200x300.jpg)](http://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/original.jpg) The Global Migration Film Festival\[/caption\]
