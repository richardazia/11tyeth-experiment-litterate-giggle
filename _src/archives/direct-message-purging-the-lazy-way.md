Damon Aka. [Dacort](http://www.twitter.com/dacort) on twitter has come out with a new toy which meant that [Meg Fowler](http://www.twitter.com/megfowler) deleted all her direct messages. Twitter is both public and private. Tweets are the public portion and DM are the private. [Dacort](http://www.twitter.com/dacort) came out with a Firefox tool that allows you to quickly [delete tweets](http://dcortesi.com/tools/dm-deleter/) from everyone or individuals. I tried it earlier but I can't bring myself to deleting everyone's DMs at this moment in time. Maybe later.
