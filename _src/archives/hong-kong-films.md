[Once Upon a Time in China Box](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005K9O2/perspectives)

This is a Hong Kong film starring Jet Li as Wong Fei-hun who is fighting for the rights of his people whom are being sent as slaves to California. At the same time he must save his Aunt from Chinese forces coming into conflict with the slave traders armed with firepower.

[The One](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005V1WW/perspectives%22)

In a world of Parallel universes each time a version of yourself is killed the remaining versions gain power. In this movie one particular version aims to become "The One"Watch Jet Li in a fight sequence against himself 

[Blade of Fury](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/6304852703/perspectives)

Beginning with a beautiful sword display this film is one of my favorites. Based on a warrior whom is living a calmer life but is encouraged by a minor government official to become more active. In so doing he becomes a target himself. All in all the film's characters are very interesting and honor plays an important in this particular film. The fight choreography is also worthwhile with particularly interesting moments. 

[Drunken Master](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005YUNV/perspectives)

Drunken Master starring Jackie Chan as the rebellious son of a Kung Fu master is sent to see So Hi whom is another Kung Fu master. He begins training with this master and at the beginning the treatment looks harsh but as the film progresses we see the value of the "Drunken" style of Kung Fu. The level of the martial arts are astounding and there are many moments of comedy interspersed throughout the movie.

The play between Jet Li and Bridget Fonda add a more human feel to the movie allowing for a more balanced film.There are some good fight sequences and it's refreshing to see Paris in a movie.
