Yesterday I decided that I would track how many tweets I receive within a 24hr period. The result is not that bad. Over that period 917 tweets transited through my timeline. These tweets are sent according to the time of day. Some of them are sent during the Australian morning, European morning and goodnight time for America. As a result there should be some visible peaks at certain times of day. It's an average of 38 tweets an hour, not to bad when you consider that reading a hundred and fourty characters takes only a second or two to scan over. Out of those tweets the vast majority are in English although I get Spanish, Italian, French, German, Dutch and Swedish to name those I remember off the top of my head. The topic of these tweets is quite diverse from people's project progress to websites they enjoy as well as to their daily lives. It's an interesting aperÃ§u of what all these social (new) media people are doing. Many friendships are built up as a result of this social network. It's still interesting and I look forward to getting a higher average than a measly 38 messages an hour. Add me on twitter and I'll follow you too.
