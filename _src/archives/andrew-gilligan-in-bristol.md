Tonight I'm in Bristol.Â  I just listened to Andrew Gilligan give a little speech about journalism and some interesting aspects. It was filmed with two cameras and the video should be available in the near future. I also met [John Charteris Black](http://tinyurl.com/25fgxv) who wrote a few books as listed in the link I provided above.
