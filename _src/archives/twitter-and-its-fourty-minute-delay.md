Today twitter has reminded me of why I dislike how it's managed. With the big Mac World event and CES twitter is down, for the count. The problem is that these crafty people have decided that rather than take the site down completely they would let it lag. As a consequence of this lag the site has been rendered redundant but don't worry. Other sites like plurk, friendfeed and facebook are still standing.
