This yodelling video is currently the number one trending video on youtube. I am unclear on whether it is for Switzerland or a bigger region. A small tractor is driving up a Swiss Alpine road with a group of yodelers sitting in a trailer. A car with Ma Cherie playing on the radio overtakes and the yodelers start to yodel the song. This video is on the Canton de Valais Youtube account.

### Hydroelectric Power

Sixty percent of the of hydroelectric power produced in Switzerland comes from Valais with its 26 dams of which La Grande Dixence is one. They have French, English and German versions of this video.

### From one side of the lake to the next by Pedalo

To keep the theme of renewable energy we have another project, to cross the lake in a solar powered Pedalo. It's in French. I thought it was a project with an environmental goal at first.

### Flying over Valais

Continuing with the theme of environmentally friendly activities Parapente is another. It's a nice way to see such a pleasant landscape, especially if you find ascending air currents that prolong the flight.

### Skydiving without the parachute

A few weeks ago after the [Via Ferrata de la Farinetta](https://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/third-part-saillon-vf/) near Saillon, I posted an image or two to Instagram and [RealFly](https://realfly.ch/en/) Sion liked the image. They're the first indoor Sky diving simulator in Switzerland. It provides people with the opportunity to try skydiving without freefalling thousands of metres. This is an experience I would eventually like to try. I'm used to having the sensation of flying in a similar position underwater so trying it in a strong current of air would be fun.
