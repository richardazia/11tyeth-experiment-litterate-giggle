There are many Geo location websites in the web. They have something in common. Using them openly in front of others will not result in positive opinions. As a result of this you want them to work flawlessly. Spending three minutes logging in is too long. That's why foursquare has been deleted grim my phone. I am not ready to use that type of service when the site goes down for four hours. I feel this way after twitter. Popular site with a lot if downtime. Relations between people degraded as communication became more hit and miss. Now friendships and the core of interesting users is gone. Why invest in social networks where indifference is prevalent. Tara for now foursquare. See you in a year.
