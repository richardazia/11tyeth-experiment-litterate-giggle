Have you seen someone walking along the gantry of a crane to detach the counterweight for a crane? I did. Today. He was clipped in, as you would assume but I am unclear as to whether he went clack clack like we do on via ferrata.

Would you want to do this. I don’t think I would mind, if I was secured properly. I also wouldn’t mind if I had the time to get used to being high again.

In Spain I have the funny sensation that I am drinking pool water every time I drink water from the tap. It rained at least twice during my time in Spain and the pool has gone from 21c to 18c so today I jumped in with my semi dry suit. With a semi dry suit you can jump in to cold water and although you feel a cool trickle of water you don’t get cold. I used it often for cold water diving.

If you’re looking for a November challenge then could I suggest this course? [100 day web developer course 2022](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code-web-development-bootcamp/). An eighty hour challenge for the motivated. It’s currently 9chf instead of 89chf. It’s worth buying.
