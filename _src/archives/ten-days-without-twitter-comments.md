What makes the first meetups so great is that you spend weeks and months talking to people, you develop a relationship with those people so that when you finally meet them you're really happy. That feeling is made even nicer when you realise you have similar interests to people you had not met yet.  
  
Now the tweetups and other meetings often feel like a formality, nothing fun, nothing innovative. That is not to say that I don't like tuttle. In fact I do like tuttle because there you still have that young entrepreunerial spirit, those innovators and thinkers. There's a lot to be gained from the tuttle meetups. That's a concept that works really well in my eyes.  
  
I'm not leaving twitter, I'm just taking a holiday, a leave of absence until I can look at the twitter timeline without the event I dislike appearing in the timeline.
