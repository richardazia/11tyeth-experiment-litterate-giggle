Caution Bees

I could have been closer to take a picture but I don’t want to run the risk of taunting Melissa, the bee, from Greek Mythology. I don’t like walking this close to hives.

You see plenty of little flecks flying around and you know that’s you’re going to cross their flight path. None of them showed an interest in me luckily. I don’t remember seeing them there before.
