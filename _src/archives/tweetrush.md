[Tweetrush](http://tweetrush.com/) is based on the rushhour engine and aims at providing information on the volume of tweets that are sent every hour of the day. At the present 800,000 tweets are sent a day. That's an average of 33,300 an hour. I only tweet at about 86 (not 200) a day depending on conversations. You can see user's tweet rate as well. It's a fun litle app that can help picture how twitter is growing at present.
