For Valentine's day I reached my 50,000th tweet which I dedicated to @orchideane through twitterfone, as asked by @toppgold. I really want to lay in to twitter for having database maintenance. really I do, but I won't. I'll concentrate on other things. There; contemporary joke: What's the difference between twitter and the Stock market? None they're both down.
