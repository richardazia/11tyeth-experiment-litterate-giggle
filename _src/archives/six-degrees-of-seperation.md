Last night I watched [Six Degrees of Separation](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=as2&path=ASIN/0792846486&tag=perspectives&camp=1789&creative=9325)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=perspectives&l=as2&o=1&a=0792846486). I had heard about it a few years ago when one of the first networking sites began. The aim of the website was to prove that you were related to everyone through six degrees. What this meant that was that by knowing a friend of a friend of a friend of a friend of a friend of a friend you were related to everyone. The idea of the website was to see primary connections, i.e. your friends and then the friends of friends. The site didn't survive that long but over websites came after it so the idea is still around through myspace and over such social networking websites.
