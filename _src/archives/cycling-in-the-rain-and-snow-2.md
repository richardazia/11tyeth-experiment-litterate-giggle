My passion for the sport came back when I had fun with a friend cycling around London. That experience showed me that London is even smaller than I thought. As an enthusiastic walker I already learned how to get around central London. To do so on a bike provided me with a new perspective of the town. In the summer of 2015 I cycled around one thousand kilometers. In the process I got to enjoy the summer heat and seeing the landscape at a different speed. It gave me the opportunity to see more of Geneva and the Vaud countryside. I even went to a slow-up in Bulles. In the process of cycling so much I wore down the rear tire which is meant for cross country rather than road cycling. In January, I replaced the old tires with slick tires and started the year running and then cycling. As we had three weeks of rain on a daily basis I eventually decided to stop using the weather as an excuse and went for runs and bike rides in the rain. When running, I came back soaked. When cycling I came back soaked, covered in mud and cold. \[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="383"\]![](http://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/images/snowbike.jpeg) Snowbike\[/caption\] After cycling in the snow, I came back and some gears were unusable due certain cogs on the rear cassette freezing. As a consequence of these bad weather bike rides, I had to clean the bike to remove all dirt and re-lubricate the chain to avoid rust and to get the bike to run properly once again. Cycling in these conditions is fun because it requires concentration and focus but I can't wait for the conditions to improve and to start enjoying sports comfortably once more. Summer is such a nice time of year for cyclists.
