I find the image in this tweet interesting. I don't know the context of this location. I find the wooden building interesting. I also find it interesting to see the lighter patch around where the chimney exhausts. It is something out of the ordinary and could be interesting to see in person.

To find out more about this building you can watch an SRF [Ding Dong episode](https://www.srf.ch/play/tv/ding-dong/video/wohnen-im-felsen?urn=urn:srf:video:d3237d4f-d307-42f1-b7df-a5286a186c35) in German. They speak about this home about six minutes in. The program reminds me of a Swiss German Grand Designs or similar type of program. The structure looks normal. There is a space behind the building where you can walk between the building and the rock.
