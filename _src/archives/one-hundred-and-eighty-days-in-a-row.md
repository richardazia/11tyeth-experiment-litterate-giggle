Writing one hundred and eighty blog posts in a row is a challenge. I would say that I have learned something but I haven’t. Some days inspiration comes easily and other days I struggle to find something to write.

We are in a pandemic and most days resemble the one before and the day after. Most days are not unique. We are grinding through this pandemic until someone competent takes control of the country’s response. I would like them to work towards Covid zero but leaders are not confident enough to set that as a goal in many countries.

If only this was a photo blog I would not be struggling to write content every day.
