Soon I may have internet access in my halls again and at that point the writing will begin again. it's hard to be inspired in a library. On the positive side I've watched up to three new documentaries since last night so I'm wondering whether to look at the origins of french and English cinema. I had some inspiration whilst attempting to watch Nightmail by Grierson. Tonight I shall be watching Philibert's L'empire des Sourd, documentary I recently read about. I went to see Borat and it's really amusing, a good excuse to laugh for more than an hour.
