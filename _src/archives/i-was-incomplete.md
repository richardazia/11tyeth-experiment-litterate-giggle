Yesterday I talked about feeds not being incomplete and how it was a shame that we could not read the article unless we had a connection to the sites in question. [Desertrose0601](http://twitter.com/desertrose0601) on twitter pointed out in a blog comment that I was guilty ofÂ  the same thing that I was commenting on. That has since been resolved.
