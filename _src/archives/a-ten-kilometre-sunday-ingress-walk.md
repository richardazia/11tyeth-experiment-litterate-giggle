I was going to take the scooter but it was stuck by three SUVs so I had no option but to lazily give up and go on a 10 kilometre Sunday Ingress walk. I couldn't be bothered running up to the second floor, getting the car keys, moving the car, getting the scooter out and then moving the car back. This is especially true since it's going to rain tomorrow.

I do have the goal of having at least one day a week without using an internal combustion engine so by the neighbours each having jeeps/SUVs I reduced my own carbon footprint. Days without internal combustion are always good.

Ingress Screengrab of missions.

My goal was to complete the Nyon by night set of missions. It's the top line in the screengrab above. It's a quick set of missions to complete with just a hack but portal for six portals. As the servers were not acting up or slow the time it took to do the walk was enough to complete the six missions. In the process, I captured a few portals and established a few more fields over the city.

While on this walk I listened to the [You're Dead to Me](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p07mdbhg/episodes/downloads) podcast by the BBC. It's a podcast that explores history in a light-hearted manner. It has a comedian, an expert on the topic of the episode and the presenter. In the episode I listened to they were discussing [Harriet Tubman](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p07n8pqw), It's the little brother of the [In Our Time](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qykl/episodes/downloads) Podcast.

When I was playing Ingress a few years ago I didn't track the walk with a GPS. I tracked it for this walk. You see that rather than be a large circular hike without overlaps you have the opposite. You see that I walked over certain streets in Nyon two or three times. You also see that there are thorns where I walk to the right or left of my course to get a portal or other.

It's especially around the Centre of Nyon that you see that I walk through many more streets than usual. On a normal walk, I'd walk from A to B choosing the most direct route. In this case, I go up and down certain streets two or three times.

If you do this without trying to complete a mission it will be even more chaotic as you walk from portal to portal to hack, capture, up, field or other.

During the lull between summer sports and winter sports Ingress is a good way for some people to get out and be physically active without necessarily driving for hours.
