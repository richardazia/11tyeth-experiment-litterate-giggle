Just had to let you know I probably wouldn't have seen this post had it not been in my Google Reder. Though I don't use it as much anymore to keep up with news sites, but it's still the place I go to keep track of friends' and acquaintances' blogs and do targeted research. I, too, used Zite for a while, but haven't in a while. Now I use Flipboard to bring together lots of different information sources and discover new content, and while it's one of my favorite iPhone/iPad apps, there still isn't something comparable I've found to use on my laptop. And, I still use Flipboard to read my Google Reader feeds on mobile.
