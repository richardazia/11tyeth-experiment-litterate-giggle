Well, I know a lot of people who has the iPhone and crashed a lot. It's really with any phone, had problems with iphone, had problems with palm. Nothing you can do really. Sometimes you will never ever have a problem. All I have now is a crappy free phone from AT&T. Hey but it works, I rarely call anyone, nor anyone calls me.  
  
But someday, I think, there may be a phone that is better than the iPhone. You never know.
