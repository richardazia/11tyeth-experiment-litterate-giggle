A penguin feeding a chick.

I would never expect to see a penguin feeding a chick in the middle of Switzerland in the middle of summer in Switzerland but I did. It’s just a wooden statue but that doesn’t make it any less unexpected. At first I thought it was just a block of wood to block people from taking a parking spot.

Two new books from the lending library.

I found two new books of interest. now that I am sitting I can look through them.
