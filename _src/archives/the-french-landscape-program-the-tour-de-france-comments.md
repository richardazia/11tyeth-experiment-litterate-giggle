When living in the US, my husband would avidly watch the Tour de France because it was a way for him to see France and French landscapes from so far away. He loves cycling as well, so that helped, but I've noticed that he watches the Tour much less avidly now that we're back in Europe and he gets a decent (well, pre-COVID, anyway) dose of France paysages on a regular basis. He still tunes in to see how things are going, but it's much less a glued-to-the-screen gazing onto France rolling past the cameras than it was back in the day. :)
