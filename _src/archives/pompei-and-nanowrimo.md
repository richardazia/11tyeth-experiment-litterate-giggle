I'm enjoying the process of writing for Nanowrimo and to get some ideas I'm looking at maps offered up by google.  
[View Larger Map](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=Pompei,+Italy&sll=40.749182,14.500738&sspn=0.074256,0.133038&g=Pompei&ie=UTF8&ll=40.75753,14.504957&spn=0.002223,0.004157&t=h&z=14&source=embed) It's quite funny because until five minutes ago I had not yet looked at the city of Pompei as seen from the sky although I've walked the streets many times. I thought that you too might enjoy this.
