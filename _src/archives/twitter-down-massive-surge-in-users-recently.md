[![twitter unreliable again](http://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/twitter-wrong-300x216.jpg "twitter-wrong")](http://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/twitter-wrong.jpg)

For all those that thought twitter was finally a reliable service with a crappy api there is some sad news. Due to a massive increase in the number of users (according to a number of sources) twitter is once again providing a truly rubbish service. We'll see how long they're going to be unreliable this time.
