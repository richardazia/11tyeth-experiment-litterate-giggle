Loic Le Meur yesterday released Twhirl to anyone willing to give their name and e-mail address. As a result I am using the latest version of twhirl and it finally offers the ability to record straight from twhirl. That means you can record video straight from twhirl. No more web interface. Of course [some credit](http://www.romefort.net/?p=13) should go to Critter and Seesmicair. His project became a reality.
