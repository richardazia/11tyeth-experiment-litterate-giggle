I am going for a run and a walk three times a week at the moment. The run is set by the Garmin Coach and the walk is set by the route I have chosen to use on that specific day. By running the first part of my daily walk I increase my fitness, according to Strava, Sports Tracker and one or two other apps.

At the same time by running, rather than walking these routes I am saving time. A walk that would usually take ten minutes per kilometre is cut down to seven, or less. The runs have gone from 1.6 km, to 2.4 to 3.2 and more. As the runs get longer so the distance I cover increases, and so the daily walk distance takes less time, as it is run instead. The aim is still to run 5km comfortably, not to increase the distance beyond 5k, for now.

Yesterday I found the run harder than on previous days. It might be due to running too soon after lunch, but also because I never take "rest" days. I will always walk from seven to ten kilometres a day, whatever the weather, whatever the mood. My body doesn't get the opportunity to rest, that it might want. It could also be psychological.

Tomorrow the run jumps from being 2.4km to 3.22 kilometres long. After finding the last run harder I expect the same for the next one. If I wanted to make my life easier I could run by one of the lakes, either Divonne or Lac LÃ©man. Both are relatively flat and both have the required distance to cover. One of the best features of that run would be that it is either downhill for the first two kilometres, to flat for the last part. One drawback is that I don't like the last two kilometres for that loop. Too many couples and dog walkers... although I did find a track by the woods that I could use, rather than walk close to others.

And Finally

I struggled to find inspiration to write today, and I expect that I will struggle for the next week, to three weeks, as my routine is altered.
