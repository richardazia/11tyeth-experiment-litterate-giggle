This morning whilst tweeting with Fahran Rehman we decided that we would like to organise a twitter event in London with a difference. Twestival and twinterval are great ideas but we're thinking of doing something over a period of two days that would be like a podcamp but over two days and we need your ideas to make it worthwhile. Already we have [27 people on facebook](http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=70522766112) interested in the project and another [6 so far on tweetcamp.](http://barcamp.org/TweetCamp) It would take place in London in the not too distant future normally. The reason for it taking place in London is that there are over 10,000 twitter users theoretically based in London already so we might expect at least two to three hundred to come along to participate. If you're interested in participating then put your name down and let's get the project underway and see how much interest we can gather.
