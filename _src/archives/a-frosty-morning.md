Yesterday we had rain and with that rain came a night cold enough for everything to be covered in ice. As I came out of the train station in Nyon I could feel my feet slip frequently. In the process walking was treacherous for those who are not experienced with the pleasure of walking on ice. For others it is an opportunity to look for possible pictures.

On a minivan I saw this pattern on the windowscreen. Water seems to have been blown by the wind at just the right speed to create this fun little pattern. It's the type of pattern we should look for right before defrosting a car. This isn't my car so I was just looking to see whether it was a boring sheet or more. In this case it looks like pine needles from a pine tree so it's nice to look at. Nature finds elegant solutions.

The second pattern of interest I saw was on this pond. When the wind is calm during morning hours the building reflects in the pond. Today the reflection includes a pattern of ice, to add character.

Tuesday should be a good day to hunt for possible images. The air temperature is meant to go down to -6c in the morning. It only lasts for one day so it's not ideal for proper ice pictures but if there is enough wind then the lakeside could look as it did two or three years ago.
