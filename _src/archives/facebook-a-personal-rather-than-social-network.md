Ten years ago if you met someone and they gave you their visit card you'd put it away somewhere and eventually you might have come back to it but the information would need updating. Over the years social networking tools on the web have evolved from simple mail clients to web forums and finally to [Myspace](http://www.myspace.com) and [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com). With [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com) we find what I think of as an enhanced phonebook. When you meet someone at a party today there's a good chance that this individual has a facebook presence. As a result when you go home they may add you as a friend and in so doing you are brought into their lives. You can see where they've worked, for how long and what they were doing. you can see whom they associate with and how they tend to meet people. Facebook has becomeÂ  a daily feature of contemporary life. Facebook does not limit your interactions to the people you've met during your time at parties, events and more. It also allows you to join groups, some are based on occupation, others on passions and yet some more on soemthing that may be relevant to only ten to twenty people. As these groups multiply so you decide to associate through these people through forums and the likes. For a time I was part of the [Lecture napping appreciation society](http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=2215172235) whilst others were part of the ["curse of the N18"](http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=2245474991) amongst other groups. Today a friend joined [a group](http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=18408152120) which I would never join for the simple and good reason (simple et bonne raison) that reflects the views for which I avoid the place. I'm living between London, a city of up to twelve million (depending on the demographics you chose) and a village of no more than 2000. I love the contrast between the two and as a result feel no need to visit the place that the group boasts about. The point is that as a medium becomes more commonplace and as more people feel comfortable with the technology so their personalities are reflected in a variety of ways which give a great wealth and diversity of character to the medium they are using. It is precisely because of those differences in interests that we gain as a social group. We, the international internet users, have a great wealth of opinions and views available within a few keystrokes and we should constantly aim to promote those interests that most effectively reflect our character, things that friends may take years to notice but that can be made obvious online. Facebook, in my opinion, is a personal, rather than social network where you promote the interaction between friends you've had for years and friends you've only just met. There are other networks that are great for making new online friends but Facebook should be kept for those people whom you have met face to face.
