During the short period when we had the "Siberian weather". many people went over to Versoix to look at the frozen lake and the beauty revealed as ice and wind played with stillness to form nice creations. These pictures were taken between Bellevue, Versoix and the Port de Crans. I particularly like the ice globs that have formed on the reeds. \[flickr-gallery mode="photoset" photoset="72157629285504573"\]
