My first impressions were that the new FaceBook looks a lot like FriendFeed. I'm also noticing some other things in the new Facebook layout that apparently were not fully thought out prior to the new launch.  
  
I do like the features of FaceBook and Friendfeed where I can actually have a discussion/conversation in more than 140 characters.
