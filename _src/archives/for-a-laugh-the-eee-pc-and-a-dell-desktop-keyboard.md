[![](http://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/eee-dell-300x225.jpg "eee-dell")](http://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/eee-dell.jpg) I really enjoy using the EEE PC but there is one tiny flaw, the keyboard is to small to do any real typing. That's why when I got home I plugged in a spare keyboard and mouse from a desktop and started to type. It works really well. No problems detecting the keyboard or anything. Since we've all got a spare keyboard and mouse lying around why not take advantage of that when we want to do some real work on the EEE PC. By the way I can touch type on the EEE so this is a question of comfort and playfulness.
