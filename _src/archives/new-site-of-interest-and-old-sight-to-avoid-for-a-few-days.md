Once more facebook is down due to site maintenance and it's making me think that it's time to move onto another site for a number of days until they sort everything out. That's where [Tubemogul](http://www.tubemogul.com/ "Video sharing and analytics") comes in, a video sharing website.

[![Facebook down](http://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/snapshot-2007-08-01-10-53-38.jpg)](http://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/snapshot-2007-08-01-10-53-38.jpg)

Whilst it has hardly anything to do with Facebook Tubemogul is nonetheless an interesting website because it encourages you to upload your videos to several online communities at once. I've been trying it out over the past twelve hours and so far I'm quite pleased with it.

What I love is the ability to upload to several video sharing websites at once and here's a visual representation of what this implies ;)
