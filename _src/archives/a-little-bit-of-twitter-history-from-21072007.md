Hello Twitter-ers! As you may already know, Obvious is the parent company of Twitter and it's never a dull day around here. Today our little building is abuzz with activity surrounding an announcement that Odeo (another Obvious product) is ready for a new home. We're entertaining offers from potential buyers because Odeo deserves the same love and attention we've been heaping on Twitter these days. Have you been by lately? http://twitter.com More about Odeo: http://tinyurl.com/2yoy84 Defamer Brings The Oscars to Twitter Popular Hollywood gossip blog Defamer.com is going to the Oscars this Sunday and they're bringing Twitter!

We've heard from people in the Interactive, Music, and Film industries who are excited to get on Twitter during the week-long event. We'll have big screens set up in the hallways and we're setting up a special, easy way for folks to get their updates on the screens. Once we set that up, we'll tell you more. Even if you can't make it to SXSW, you'll still be able to catch all the buzz. Office Full of Great Folks Obvious employs less than ten people but the building is filling up fast since we've opened our doors to some other really cool companies working on interesting projects. Two of the projects are still top secret, there's a couple Y Combinator startups sharing space with us, and the other folks are 30boxes.com, Boso.com, and the illustrious Niall Kennedy. (Hi Niall!) When the secret projects launch, we'll tell you about them--they're cool! http://30boxes.com http://boso.com http://www.niallkennedy.com/ http://ycombinator.com/ Okay, back to work. Lots to do this week! Happy Twitter-ing, Biz Stone and the Twitter Team http://twitter.com/biz
