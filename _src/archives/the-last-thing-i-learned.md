> What is the last thing you learned?

I am currently learning to run five kilometres again. I'm one week away from completing the training program. This isn't learning in the conventional sense of the word. It's about fitness and endurance. About pacing and stamina.

I have run five k in half an hour in the past. I managed to run 10k and more. I stopped because my knees disliked my running. Now I am running again. In less than eight days I will have completed the challenge and I will be able to move on to something else. I ran 5.6km two days ago. The next runs are one or two short runs, and a 5k run.

The biggest challenge today, with the 4k run was running directly into the wind. At 21km/h according to Strava or 28km/h according to Garmin connect it almost stopped me when I ran into it. You just push forward, until you're facing a different direction.

Today it was raining and I wore glasses anyway. They steamed up at one point so I took them off. Running in the cold and rain isn't too unpleasant, until the rain blows onto wet trousers and you start to cool. I wore quick drying hiking trousers and I changed when I got home. It's more comfortable than wearing rainproof layers and a winter jacket.

When it rains I usually wear the cycling rain coat. It has no hood but it's light and practical for these conditions. For half an hour to fourty minutes it is fine.

Recently I have been running on rainy days, and having rest days on days with nice weather. I am getting to run in sub-optimal conditions.

Summer is almost back. I Hope that this year will be more interesting and inspiring than "I walked, ran and cycled in circles."
