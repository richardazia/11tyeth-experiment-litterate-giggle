This happened to me in the past month. I was surprised, but as I just tried to use the mobile phone version on my new phone, I guessed it was the result of that. The weird thing is that it never happened since then. You have an idea what and where can cause his problem? (Just curiosity. The one that killed the cat.)

I don't think anything broke, just some minor problems with cookies. If you are experiencing this on your mobile device in, say Opera Mini or similar, I suggest clearing you cache and/or cookies. I had problems accessing the www version on my BlackBerry as twitter suddenly insisted on showing me the m version every time I accessed www.twitter.com with Opera Mini 4 - even after I had repeatedly requested the 'standard' www version. I deleted my cookies and it is now working again.
