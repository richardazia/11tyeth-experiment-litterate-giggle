I often hiked with a Sigg one litre water bottle and it has served me well. It has been with me for rock climbing, via ferrata, hiking and more. I like it because it is light, easy to use and maintain. I liked the one litre version enough to get a smaller 600ml version for conferences and work.

Recently I noticed that the mouth of both bottles seems slightly discouloured. I don't know whether they're chipped or whether it's oxydation from sitting around for so many months during the pandemic. I will probably still use them, once the world decides that Zero-Covid is the right strategy.

My other solution was a 750ml camelbak waterbottle and I find that this is a good solution too. I found that it was too large for home use, and everyday use so I'm now playing with a 600 ml water bottle and I prefer this form factor. It's better for carrying on daily walks.

When I was studying about water filtering solutions I often came across the mention of nalgene bottles and after over a year of hearing about them, but having no curiousity in them I bought one a few days ago. I like that it has a graduated system on the side although I don't usually need to ration water.

The wide mouth and it's cap are suboptimal for drinking, especially if you're walking. The advantage of nalgene wide mouths is that they helped to set the standard, at least according to one or two articles I read. This means that you can take most camelbak tops and put it on a nalgene bottle and vice versa. This increases drinking comfort.

There is no need to buy specialist tools or brushes, or cleaning tablettes etc.
