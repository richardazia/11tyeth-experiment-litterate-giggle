Yesterday I went to see [Arrest](https://cineuropa.org/fr/film/373424/) - screened at the [Black Movie film festival](https://www.facebook.com/BlackMovieFestival/). It's an independent film festival taking place in Geneva at the moment. I'm a volunteer at the event and in exchange for standing at the door and checking tickets, I get to see any film that still has space.

The provisional title of this film was 1983 and because I walked in a few minutes into the film I missed the beginning. The entire film takes place in a prison cell and looks at how two characters were interrogated. It looks at the dynamic between both characters.

While watching this film it reminded me of The Gulag Archipelago because it gives a glimpse into life under [Nicolae Ceau?escu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolae_Ceau%C8%99escu).
