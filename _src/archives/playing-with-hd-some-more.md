Yesterday I was playing some more with the High definition camera and got a few more seconds of footage uploaded. Right click or control click to download the files and alt/option F to play them full screen. [Leaves](http://www.main-vision.com/hd/leaves.mov) [Castle](http://www.main-vision.com/hd/castle.mov) [Bird](http://www.main-vision.com/hd/bird.mov) [Waves](http://www.main-vision.com/hd/waves.mov) Now I wih I had an HD monitor to view the footage properly. Look at the detail on the shot of the castle. You see so much. Really nice image to work with.
