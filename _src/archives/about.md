A year ago I founded Mainvision Productions SÃ RL to focus my attention on the production of documentaries and short films. At the moment I am in post production for a low budget film called Oxy, which was filmed a few months ago.Â I also work as a consultant for Eurovision, helping with network resource management. I would love to produce a documentary about Via Ferrata. I am familiar with many of those in Switzerland and France within a three hour driving radius of Geneva. I need talent to be in front of the camera. Should you be interested then please contact me. I live in Switzerland and am willing to travel. My camera equipment includes a Sony PMW-200 video camera, a Vinten tripod with Blue Vision head and a sennheiser wireless lapel kit. I have a macbook pro which I use solely for editing using Final Cut Pro X. I am a Padi Rescue diver currently working on my CMAS \*\*\* rating and Advanced Nitrox Certification.
