Spring is finally back and the fun sports are about to start again. Via Ferrata, Rock climbing, hiking and other sports will be possible and we will see what new places I explore.Â While waiting for the season to start properly I took some time to film bees pollinating a form of apple tree. The images were captured with a Sony PMW-200. This camera records high quality images. [Springwatch - some swiss bees](https://vimeo.com/165009340) from [Mainvision](https://vimeo.com/user14581240) on [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com). This summer I will work on projects and share them.I hope to realise my documentary about via ferrata at last. I have acquired some new skills but need to find people with whom to collaborate with.
