I was looking for this type of information online and I found a few websites that provided such information. This one is useful because it is full of Greek and Roman mythological people so it serves as a good resource.

I found it at one of the phone boxes turned into a book library locations.

My intention is to skim through this book and slowly to get a good overview of the complex topic. I didn’t know that Musée was a name, not just a place.
