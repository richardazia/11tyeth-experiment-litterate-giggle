Walking and finding old trees is still possible if you look around. If you're attentive you can find trees that are hundreds of years old. They are massive compared to younger trees. Their trunk is broad and their branches are complex.

If you walk around the Mediterranean you will find thousand-year-old olive trees and if you walk around Switzerland it is also possible to find old trees. There are two or three parks in Geneva where you can find them. You can find them at the [Chateau De Penthes](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch%C3%A2teau_de_Penthes) and other places.

The Sequoia that once stood tall and proud in the Chateau de Penthes. It was struck by lightning. This is its stump, with a sapling growing out of its remains.

There was a branch growing out of the tree to the left that was growing sideways and almost touched the floor when we were younger. It was fun to stand on the branch and make it move. Since then that branch has grown and now touches the floor so the game is over. In the background you can see the Lac LÃ©man, with the alps and the Mont Blanc in the distance.

Old trees are instantly recognisable because they are either tall and broad like the Sequoia that used to live at the Chateau De Penthes or the one by the lake in Nyon before it died and was cut down. Others, such as the one featured in this blog post are broad with a complex system of branches. Another one is near the sports centre in Crans. It is located [here](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Crans-pr%C3%A8s-C%C3%A9ligny/@46.3598265,6.2061333,155m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x478c5d4c32a68983:0x650fa20a31c72b9e!8m2!3d46.3598471!4d6.2064619).

It's easy to drive or cycle by this tree without noticing. When you stop and stand next to it you see that the trunk is broad and the branch system is interesting.

Sequoias by the Parc Mon Repos in Geneva.

If you walk by the lakeside in Geneva you can see a few old trees. These sequoias are by the road that enters or leaves Geneva, depending on whether you live inside or outside of Geneva. If you're ready to walk a few minutes you will find them easily.

Flying around a tree in Eysins

Of course one of the advantages of old trees that are in the middle of fields is that you can get footage of them from various angles that would only be accessible with a crane camera or other tools. With video you will see the complex branch system, the width of the trunk and if you're filming at the right time of year, the biome that lives within it. I flew around this tree in spring, when it was flowering. Enjoy the majesty of this tree.
