I just noticed that I'd love living in Singapore because that's the city where people walk the fastest. Copenhaguen is a city I've walked in but I didn't notice it being particularly fast. Berliners walk faster than New Yorkers and Londoners walk slower than all of the above. I wonder how I'd compare to all these people and how I'd affect the averages. It' just the type of news story I enjoy. Out of all these cities Malawi is the slowest. It's 20 seconds slower than the rest.
