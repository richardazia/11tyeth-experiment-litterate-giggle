Last night I started using [newsgator](http://www.newsgator.com/) on the ipod touch and today I've come to the conclusion that I really enjoy [this app](http://www.newsgator.com/Individuals/NetNewsWireiPhone/Default.aspx). The reason for this is mobility. With the ipod touch I synchronise the feeds before I leave the computer and at my leisure I can read all the feeds and clip those that I think are relevant for later reading or to be shared. It's also a nice way of feedreading because it's small and practical. No laptop to carry around and no need for wifi to view the content.
