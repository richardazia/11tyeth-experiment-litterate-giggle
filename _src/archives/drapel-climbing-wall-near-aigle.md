The Drapel Climbing Wall near Aigle is a nice place to climb. When I was there yesterday we were in the shade of the trees unless we were climbing. The temperature for this week is at around 25-27°c daily which is nice. These are almost summer temperatures, at last. The parking for this climbing wall is

### Getting there

The parking for this climbing wall is [here](https://www.google.com/maps/place/46%C2%B019'38.2%22N+6%C2%B058'13.5%22E/@46.3272781,6.9682374,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x0!8m2!3d46.3272781!4d6.9704261?hl=en). I'm giving a specific location because when I looked at maps I was not filled with confidence. To get to the parking you go to Yvorne and from there towards Vers Monthey. You drive through a narrow gap between two houses and then along a viticultural road towards the forest. You go up a dirt road for a few metres. The parking is a clearing in the woods. From there you walk for between 10-15 minutes. You know you're at the climbing wall because there is a bench overlooking the castle. Come back a few metres and you'll see the climbing wall where there are routes.

### The Routes

Come back a few metres and you'll see the climbing wall where there are routes. At [this wall](https://www.grimper.ch/sites-de-grimpe/liste-des-sites/liste-sites/Sector/show/drapel-pierre-aux-druides/) you have 15 5a to 5c+ routes, 15 6a to 6a+ routes and 20 7a to 7c+ routes. These climbs are slab and overhangs. The places are well equipped. Routes are between 28-50m. If and when you come to this climbing wall make sure you have a print-out of the routes and their difficulty. The routes are not named so you might accidentally do a 6a route and exhaust yourself immediately, as we did. I would definitely come back to this wall and this time I would make sure to climb routes that are gradually harder as the day progresses.
