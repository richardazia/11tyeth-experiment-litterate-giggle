I'm back in the northwest of London waiting for Monday to come when I can fall asleep in the first lecture of the week... In reality that's probably not going to happen. Instead, it's going to be the final three modules before the course is over. It's going to be fun since I love the modules I need to do. The flight was good, enjoyed watching a film on my i-pod, and finally getting a proper opportunity to check my noise-canceling headphones out. They make quite a difference.
