I went to the [Social Media Coffee](http://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/?p=487#comments) event this morning and met quite a few of the usual people including [Deek](http://www.twitter.com/deekdeekster), [Sizemore](http://www.twitter.com/sizemore), [Londonfilmgeek](http://www.twitter.com/londonfilmgeek) and others. I got to know a few more twitter users a little better and that's where I stayed for part of the morning. I've been networking a lot over the past few days and I think i need some time to think about all the new options. It's good to get to these events and talk to people. Quite a few people are interested in twitter and because I'm edging so close to the [15,000 tweet mark](http://twitter.com/warzabidul) they're quite curious to know my thoughts on the topic. People are actually interested both in what twitter is and how twitter works. Over the months I have acquired a respectable amount of knowledge and people are starting to seek it which is great. That's just one aspect of the [Social Media cafe](http://londonsocialmediacafe.pbwiki.com/) I saw today but there is one thing that's going to change. If no one objects to it I will begin to record the conversations as they go on and edit a summary to make available both via the London Social Media Cafe website for people to consult and keep up to date. I am in discussion with [Jeff Pulver](http://jeffpulver.com/) of [PulverTV](http://pulvertv.com/) to see about covering the London side of Social media so if you know of any events that may be of interest let me know so that I may organise coverage if it's relevant.
