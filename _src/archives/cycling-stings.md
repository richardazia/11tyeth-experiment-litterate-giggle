Yesterday I was stung by a wasp while cycling and when I tried to remove the stinger I couldn't. I was in pain and almost stopped cycling. I was in distress as a bus passed on a main road. I was on an agricultural path by some apple orchards. I stopped where the agricultural road reached the main road. 

It's almost twenty four hours later and my lower lip and one of my cheeks have swelled up. A few weeks ago I had a similar incident with a bee but I was able to remove the stinger while cycling and my quick action prevented too much poison from being pumped into my lower lip. When that incident occurred I was surprised not to have any swelling. 

In previous years I have been stung twice to my right leg and at least once to the stomach. I had no adverse reaction. Being stung when you're riding a bike or scooter is normal. Usually the windshield on the scooter protects your body so that's where bugs get splattered. I often hear when bumble bees and other larger insects hit my helmet. There's that little "poc" sound on almost every ride. 

If you look at car radiators, windshields and side mirrors you will see a graveyard of insects. This year I have seen flying swarms of small insects and I've tried not to have my mouth open by accident when going through them. 

I am tempted to get a face mask, to protect my mouth. I already protect my eyes on every ride for this very reason. A face mask would be a logical next step.
