I can definitely sympathize. Even though I'm in the US, the city that I stay in is pretty non-technological, let alone social. Getting people to use social networks is a tough thing. Even though they have their benefits, it's not for everyone and everyone isn't particularly fascinated with the web in the same way that we are unfortunately.
