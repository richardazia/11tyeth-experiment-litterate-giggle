I'm happy with the news. I won't rush to climb though. I'd rather wait for two or three weeks and see what happens. If no one gets sick then we can start climbing again. If Décathlon does open I can get gloves that cover fingertips to be safe.

I have altered the route I usually walk because cows are in one of the fields I like to walk through. The alternate route requires walking along a road, so it's less pleasant because there are a greater number of people to avoid.

In the picture above you would never know that there is a path that you can walk along. It's only because one day I saw people walking from the other direction that I decided to investigate. If you walk closer you see that the gap is large enough for people to pass, as in the featured image. Even when you know where it is it's easy to miss.

It's VE day, and the poppies are out.

I saw a flower I wasn't familiar with and when I looked closer to take pictures I noticed that these were strawberry plants. The season for strawberries is almost here.

I didn't eat any because they're not ripe. They're still green, and they're on a farm, not wild. For wild ones we have to wait until we get to the mountains again.
