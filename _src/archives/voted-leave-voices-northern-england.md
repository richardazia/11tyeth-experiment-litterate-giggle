This short video provides us with voices from Northern England. We hear about the closures and about the strikes that took place decades ago. We hear superficially about migration but the key message is that the North feels abandoned by the South. The North has been fed the message that austerity is the fault of the European Union and that the European Union imposes its will on people rather than provide them with the freedom to choose. [Why we voted leave: voices from northern England](https://vimeo.com/172932182) from [Guerrera Films](https://vimeo.com/user6346317) on [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com). Although mentioned briefly London has failed rural England. Mines closing down and jobs disappearing is one thing. To have poverty and the sense of hopelessness continue for generations is harder to understand. What about education and regeneration projects?

> Parts of the city region experience skills shortages, particularly in key growth sectors and clusters. There are also significant problems of low basic skills levels, which are quite acute within some disadvantaged communities. In parts of the city region, educational performance remains lower than the national average. The city regionâ€™s labour market functions below its optimum. It has a higher than average level of worklessness, especially in inner urban and isolated rural areas. [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leeds_City_Region)

If there are skills shortages then couldn't the local community provide those who are unemployed with vocational training to learn the skills that are required? We see the same problem in Spain. There is unemployment but the source is an educational system that has not kept up with the job market.Â _â€œItâ€™s a paradox,â€ said Valentin Bote, head of research in Spain at Randstad, a recruitment agency. â€œThe unemployment rate is too high. Yet weâ€™re seeing some tension in the labor market because unemployed people donâ€™t have the skills employers demand.â€ [source](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-07-01/spain-is-running-out-of-workers-with-almost-5-million-unemployed).Â _  

> Caretaker Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, the front-runner to lead the next government after posting gains in Sundayâ€™s election, has pledged to add half a million jobs a year, but his campaign focused on posts for the legions of unemployed, rather than producing skilled workers to power the economy. Rajoyâ€™s opponents say his policy of driving down wages and stripping back job protection hasÂ mainly created poorly-paid low-skill posts.

We see that as certain jobs go to where labour is cheaper people are saying "But I want to keep doing my old job." The European Union allows people to migrate to do the job they want to do. They could move to France, Germany or other countries. Instead they stay home and express nostalgia. Their attitude if they want to stay in England should be "Well, if you take away my current job then train me to do a higher skilled job." England has a diversity of vocational training schemes at numerous levels, from BTEC to foundation degrees and more. There is no reason not to upskill when there is a shortage of work. _At a European level, Doncaster is part of the [Yorkshire and the Humber (European Parliament constituency)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yorkshire_and_the_Humber "Yorkshire and the Humber") constituency and is represented by six [MEPs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_the_European_Parliament "Member of the European Parliament").([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doncaster))Â _ _The European constituency of [Yorkshire and the Humber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yorkshire_and_the_Humber_(European_Parliament_constituency) "Yorkshire and the Humber (European Parliament constituency)") is coterminous with the English region. After the [European Parliament election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Parliament_election,_2014 "European Parliament election, 2014") in May 2014, Yorkshire and the Humber is represented by three [UK Independence Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Independence_Party "UK Independence Party") two [Labour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_Party_(UK) "Labour Party (UK)") and one [Conservative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservative_Party_(UK) "Conservative Party (UK)") [MEPs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_the_European_Parliament "Member of the European Parliament").

With over 5Â million people living in the region it ranks alongside some small countries including Ireland, Greece, Norway and Singapore.

_City region growth sectors include_

_â€¢ Financial and business services_ _â€¢ Electronics and optical_ _â€¢ Communications_ _â€¢ Health and public services_

_Niche clusters are_

_â€¢ Digital and media_ _â€¢ Bioscience and medical research_ _â€¢ Advanced niche manufacturing, including defence_ _â€¢ Logistics and distribution[\[15\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leeds_City_Region#cite_note-Devprog-15)_ Six universities in the region produce 40,000 graduates a year. [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leeds_City_Region) Democracy is about the flow of information and we see that people voted without understanding the situation. Every time a person is asked a question we see that they speak in generalities with very few concrete examples. The strongest point is about the protest and the mine closures. Look at the interview in the library. One person was in favour of remain but he was unable to explain how to affect change at an EU level. These people have six MEPs to represent them in Brussels. These are the people they should have been encouraged to bring their concerns to. I probably spent an hour researching this blog post. I was surprised by how positive the situation looks. With what seem like minor changes the inequalities currently present in Northern England could be rectified.
