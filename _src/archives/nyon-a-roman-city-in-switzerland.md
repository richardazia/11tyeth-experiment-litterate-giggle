Nyon is a town in Switzerland. It was founded by Roman troops over 2000 years ago, in 50-44 bC, after the wars in Gaul. It was named "colonia Iulia equestris", after Julius Caesar. It's older than its sister cities (Copia Felix Munatia Lugdunensis) Lyon and (colonia Raurica) which were founded in 44/43 bC by Munatius Plancus. These three cities were some of the last to be founded during the wars in Gaul for the soldiers or cavalry, giving them the name Equestris.
