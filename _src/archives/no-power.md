Something you hardly ever think of when you're in economically more developed countries is electricity because it's always there for you to use. This was not the case yesterday afternoon when coming back from an interview. Due to some roadworks or the rain (not much but apparently poor maintenance makes things worse) the power down the whole street was shorted for at least six hours, which is a long time. A machine was digging up the road and a second worker was digging. At moments he pulled on a cable, then pulled on another. Occasionaly they beeped at some people in a van before getting back to work, then they'd come back. The whole time they were seeing this as a little bit of fun. Whilst this was going on outside many homes had no power, no refrigeration, no television, no safety alarms and more. It's somethng we've grown unused to since power cuts are usually so rare.
