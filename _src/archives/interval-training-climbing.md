If you were to look at the graph below you would clearly see that it's a form of interval training but you're at a loss to know which sport it is from. With running and cycling you would see 2-3 minutes of hard effort and then two to three minutes of less effort and it would repeat form 15-20 minutes. This graph is from an activity done for two hours. \[caption id="attachment\_3480" align="aligncenter" width="1024"\][![](http://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Screen-Shot-2017-05-05-at-00.04.12-1024x382.png)](http://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Screen-Shot-2017-05-05-at-00.04.12.png) What is the first sport that comes to mind?\[/caption\] This graph is from indoor climbing yesterday. You see that I started tracking the heart rate at least ten minutes before my first climb. You see that the heart rate during the first climb climbs consistently until I reach the top. As I get lowered back to the ground my body goes back to being relaxed and you see the low heart rate as I belay someone. The second climb is more challenging so you see the peak earlier in the climb and then it remains stable. The third climb was a little harder and you see that I had to rest at least twice. The fourth climb was managed without resting. With the fifth climb we see that I really needed to rest at the point where the troth is. From what I remember of the last climb it was easy except for parts where you really need finger strength. As I do not I cheated. I don't climb frequently enough. I noticed that [Rocspot Echandens](https://www.grimper.ch/salles-descalade/lausanne-rocspot/) has logged their climbs so that they are compatible with [myclimbs](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/myclimb-log-share-your-climbing/id925359604?mt=8), an app that I installed on my phone many months ago but forgot about. At the time it was still in early development so was not of much interest. Next time I go I will use the app.
