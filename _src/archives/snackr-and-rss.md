With my love for the short form [Snackr](http://www.snackr.net/) is a welcome addition to my world as an easy way to keep an eye on rss feeds. It's a ticker box that scrolls all the latest articles. You can choose whether you whether you want every post over the past day to a week. So far it's been easy to use.
