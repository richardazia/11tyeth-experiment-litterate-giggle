[13 Minutes to the Moon](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/w13xttx2) is an interesting podcast dedicated to the Lunar Landings. This podcast, along with audiobooks, is interesting because they allow us not just to read the dialogues that took place but to hear what the controllers and astronauts heard.

At one point in Episode two, you hear [two communications loops at once.](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/p07grw0d) It's a shame that they didn't balance the audio so that loop 1 was in one ear and loop 2 in the other. If they had done this then we could have heard the audio as mission controllers had heard.

The podcast is also interesting because it's divided into twelve 50 minute podcasts so each topic is explored in depth. There is some overlap with the books I have read. For enthusiasts, this overlap is interesting as it allows them to fill in gaps in their knowledge.
