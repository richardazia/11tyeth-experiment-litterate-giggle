As I arrived home today, after a slightly more relaxed day I found that two tapes had arrived in the post. It's the ones from the final fling. I still need to go through them and find usable footage. I'm going to be editing that over the next two or three days, depending on what the work load is for the other documentary. I'm feeling inspired, thinking of the logistics of the first weeks back at uni. First I need to find a home, and once that's done work on creating an action plan firstly for the year ahead academicaly but also for the smokescreen project. I need to make sure the project is far clearer in people's minds and check that I have one or two crews that are ready to do the work professionaly, making sure to get a variety of shots for dynamic video productions.
