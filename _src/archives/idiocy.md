The more time you spend online the more headlines and articles you read, the more you see mass idiocy. Every time a phone comes out that's slightly similar to the iPhone they rant about how similar to the iPhone it is. It's not. There are several models of phones preceding it. My phone is very similar in design to the Samsung f700 but I've had it since October/November of the year. It's got a touch screen and the slide-out keyboard and it's got all the synchronization features. Why has Apple become the standard for a product they're not even releasing to the market for another half a year. What a lot of excitement for a device that's more of a gimmick than anything else. The iPhone is for the myspace generation. Those who are looking for entertainment value in electronic devices rather than usefulness. How are you going to write notes in lectures with the i-phone? One of the things I hate most about web 2.0 is that it's all about hype, what's popular, what's not. What does the mass want, what doesn't it want? Why is everything over-simplified to such an extent? At the moment you can't open a paper without the aftermath of the CBB article being rammed down your media-saturated throat yet intelligent articles like "[Identity and Migration](http://www.prospect-magazine.co.uk/article_details.php?id=8239 "Identity and Migration")" by Francis Fukuyama published in Prospect for February 2007 goes unnoticed. It's a well-written article that looks in-depth at the issues that are relevant to the future of the international community as a whole. _The disjuncture between one's inner and outer selves comes not merely out of the realm of ideas, but from the social reality of modern market democracies. After the American and French revolutions, the ideal of la carrière ouverte aux talents was increasingly put into practice as traditional barriers to social mobility were removed. One's social status was now achieved rather than ascribed; it was the product of one's talents, work, and effort rather than an accident of birth. One's life story was the search for fulfilment of an inner plan, rather than conformity to the expectations of one's parents, kin, village or priest._ One of the strongest arguments within the article is this one: _The first prong of the solution is to recognise that the old multicultural model has not been a big success in countries such as the Netherlands and Britain, and that it needs to be replaced by more energetic efforts to integrate non-western populations into a common liberal culture. **The old multicultural model was based on group recognition and group rights. Out of a misplaced sense of respect for cultural differencesâ€”and in some cases out of imperial guiltâ€”it ceded too much authority to cultural communities to define rules of behaviour for their own members. Liberalism cannot ultimately be based on group rights, because not all groups uphold liberal values**. The civilisation of the European Enlightenment, of which contemporary liberal democracy is the heir, cannot be culturally neutral, since liberal societies have their own values regarding the equal worth and dignity of individuals. **Cultures that do not accept these premises do not deserve equal protection in a liberal democracy**. Members of immigrant communities and their offspring deserve to be treated equally as individuals, not as members of cultural communities. There is no reason for a Muslim girl to be treated differently under the law from a Christian or Jewish one, whatever the feelings of her relatives._ There are some valid and interesting points within the article. Take a few minutes to read it.
