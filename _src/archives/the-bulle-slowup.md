Bulle is a city by a lake in the Canton De GruyÃ¨re in Switzerland. Last weekend they held their annual [slowup event](http://www.slowup-gruyere.ch/). A slowup is an event where roads are closed to motorised transport in favour of cyclists, roller bladers, skate boarders and other self propelling sports. The loop is around 26km long and there are ares to stop and enjoy food every few kilometres. At this event you can also get your bike maintained for free except for parts that need replacing. It's a great opportunity to take an old worn out bike and have it reconditioned. As I spent several days getting mine back in to condition I did not abuse of this opportunity. \[caption id="attachment\_2432" align="aligncenter" width="300"\][![The first climb](http://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/P1050026-300x169.jpg)](http://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/P1050026.jpg) The first climb\[/caption\] The landscape around Bulle is nice. As you cycle you can see the MolÃ©son mountains in the distance, and without clouds for a change. You can also enjoy a few climbs and descents. The gradients are not steep and the climbs are not long. A friend of mine was on rollerblade and it impresses me that she did around 30km. \[caption id="attachment\_2433" align="aligncenter" width="300"\][![Father and daughter](http://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/P1050034-300x169.jpg)](http://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/P1050034.jpg) Father and child\[/caption\] The best feature of slowups is the ability to enjoy a wide road and cycle anywhere you like without the usual cars overtaking too close and too fast. As a result parents and their children can enjoy this beautiful landscape. \[caption id="attachment\_2434" align="aligncenter" width="660"\][![BYOB, not bring your own bike or beer.

Bring your own barbecue\[/caption\] It's amusing to see someone take a cool box and barbecue for such an event. I didn't see them stop and start preparing food though.
