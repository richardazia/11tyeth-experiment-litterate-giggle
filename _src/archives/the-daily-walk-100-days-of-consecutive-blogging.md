We walk daily to look into the distance, to have fresh air, and to think about things. We take our daily walk because it's a habit. We take our daily walk because it is a way of travelling from one place to another, without necessarily changing location.

A flower, with a field, and the Alps behind it.

Today is day 100 of writing a blog post every day. Every day I have tried to find inspiration to write and every day I have succeeded. The posts go unread, but the challenge is not to be read. The challenge is to be consistent. I have managed that challenge.

We are in a pandemic so I do not travel to via ferrata, hikes in the mountains or activities. There are no conferences, so I do not go to large events. My ideas and inspiration come from what I read, see, hear or feel. As we meet very few people we also converse less. Ideas are harder to share and discuss.

I question whether, when the pandemic is over, I will have the motivation to try to resume a social life. At the moment, because we're in a pandemic, I feel that the answer is, "definitely not." This is a self defense mechanism, and a way of commenting on the one and a half years of pandemic.

We have to be solitary to cope with pandemic solitude, but we also have to be that way inclined to be in that situation.

See you tomorrow.
