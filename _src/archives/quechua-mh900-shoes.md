People who walk as much as me wear through shoes within a few months. The soles that were deep and ridged when new, become smooth as we walk, and wear away the soles. Usually I know that shoes are new, or that they need replacing the same way. They start to cause blisters, and I feel that stones are starting to be felt through the soles.

These shoes stand out from others because they are waterproof almost to the top of the shoe, so as long as lake waves are small you're fine. I tried on the lake, but with a speed boat passing seconds before, I didn't insist. I tested in the blue shower by the lake to see the result. They performed as expected.

Usually we would put shoes on, and walk once or twice, down the aisle, to see if they were comfortable, but this time I took a liberty, I walked around decathlon with two or three pairs of shoes, to see which ones I liked most. This is a worthwhile. If you forget you're wearing the shoes you're trying on, then that's a good sign. That's how I chose these over two other shoes I tried on.

According to the [marketing content](https://www.galaxus.ch/en/s3/product/quechua-shoes-mh900-wtp-m-301274-42-hiking-boots-17309844) they are meant to be comfortable for walking 20 kilometres a day, 6hrs a day. I haven't put them through that test, due to recent rainfall.

Testing waterproofing

It feels childish, to put a shoe in a basin of water like I did in the photo above. It confirms your expectations of how waterproof a shoe is. Now that I have confirmed my suspicions, I can walk through puddles, without fear of getting socks wet. With these shoes, the problem is rain seeping in through the trousers and socks, rather than through the fabric. They also have "gaiter" although I would call it a gaiter, to keep stuff out.

With time, we will see if I like them more than other shoes.
