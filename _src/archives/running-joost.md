Finally I'm home to a pc, linux and mac environment and I'm running joost. It's not bad. At the moment it's just filler content but nonetheless it's interesting to see it work and interact with it. For a few days I can offer invites to anyone that wants one. Just put a comment and I'll get back to you.
