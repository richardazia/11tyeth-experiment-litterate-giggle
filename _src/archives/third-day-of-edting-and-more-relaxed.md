It's the third day of editing and the pressure has been relieved. I've captured the footage and edited most of the multicamera show. It wasn't as bad as I thought therefore there were only a few small things to change. As I'm under time pressure I'm glad there's less to do although with more footage I may have tried to be more creative. With the myspace documentary, things are going well. We're up to about ten minutes and need another 2-5 therefore that's relaxed as well. With that edit it's a matter of getting the framework finished, finding a few more illustrative shots before finally working on the fine-cut for projection on Thursday or Friday. For the globalisation project, I haven't had time to speak to that many people so the progression has stalled. 45 credits vs. 15... Both are important but one requires a team to work at all times. The other, only two or three people. That's it for today.
