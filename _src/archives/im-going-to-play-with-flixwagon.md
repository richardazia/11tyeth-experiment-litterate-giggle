](http://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/rich95.jpg "Richard and the Nokia N95")Because three or four, I've lost track of how many, live streaming applications for the phone aren't enough i've started to play with [flixwagon](http://www.flixwagon.com/warzabidul) as well. So far it's taking some getting used to but I hope that by tomorrow I'll have learned more. It's still an alpha and only works with select phones. I could test it from here and now but it's night time and there are more interesting places from which to play.
