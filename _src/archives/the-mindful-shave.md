For two weeks or so I have been using a safety razor rather than the usual electric shaver, or conventional three to four blade shavers. In the process I have had to become more attentive to what I am doing. 

**The Usual Shave**

With an electric razor you turn it on and you shave, until you’re happy that it’s done. With a wet shave with plastic razors you wet your face, get some shaving foam on your face and shave. Both of these are fast, and easy. You’re just doing something that you have done for years, or even decades. 

**The Safety Razor Method**

With the safety razor shave things change. With the safety razor you are gently guiding a razor blade along your face. For it to be effective you need to wet, and even moisten your face. You need to make sure that, not only is your face covered in shaving soap, but that the face is wet enough for the hairs. to soften. 

It doesn’t stop there. You also have to pull your face to be taught, to be more effective, and to prevent blade bounce, because blade bounce can result in nicks and cuts. You need to be focused and attentive when you’re shaving with a safety razor because a mistake will result in a little cut. 

**Minor Cuts and Scrapes**

In my experience the cuts and nicks are minor and stop bleeding almost instantly. Psychologically though, it is frightening, to guide a razor blade along one’s face, even if it is a safety razor. 

It’s that fear and potential danger that makes shaving with a safety rewarding so rewarding. It’s because of that need for absolute focus, and methodical approach, that shaving the old fashioned way feels like pampering, rather than a chore. 

**I tried two razors. **

I have two safety razors. I bought the first one, and used it two or three times, but the blade felt too exposed and it scared me, so I bought a second one. The second one feels like it exposes less depth of the blade to my face. My rational is that if it can’t dig as deeply into my skin, if I make a mistake, it is safer. 

The razor that scared me is the Pandoo. The one that I feel more comfortable using is the Wilkinson safety razor. I feel more comfortable with it. 

**Softened Skin, and a Light Touch**

From the paragraph above you’d think “Why the bell would you shave with something so dangerous?” and the answer is that you don’t. Everything about safety razor shaving is about minimising risk. It’s about spending a minute getting the face wet, applying shaving soap and shaving within 30 seconds, before reapplying shaving soap. It’s about having a blade that is not more than five shaves old. It’s about caressing your face with the safety razor, rather than scraping your face. It’s about having a light touch. Although a safety razor sounds brutal it forces you to be gentle and attentive, to treat shaving as an intimate, rather than a mechanical experience. 

**The Result**

Shaving with a safety razor leaves the skin feeling smooth. For the duration of the shave you are focused, and in the moment. It forces you to be attentive and to be present. It also feels good. 

**And Finally**

People speak about using safety razors to reduce on plastic waste and on saving money. I think that these are good reasons to swap but I think that shaving with a safety razor is about appreciating yourself enough to give yourself a high quality shave. Shaving with a safety razor is an experience, rather than a chore. I enjoy the process. With electric razors and normal razors I didn’t. With those it felt like a daily chore, rather than mastering an art.
