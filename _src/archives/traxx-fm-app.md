Traxx.fm is a music station I've been familiar with for over a year but only recently downloaded and used as an iPhone app. It was developed by a friend in Geneva. The fitness centre where I go uses [traxx.fm](http://www.traxx.fm/) for background music. The advantage of this online live streaming option is that you have 20 themes and the playlists are compiled from a number of sources. As a result there is a wealth of music to be discovered without the drawback of over-exuberantÂ presenters. There are also no commercials. If you pay for the HD version you are helping to fund them. The reason I like the app is that it offers what last.fm used to offer to its users before being bought by AOL, continuous music you could start listening to and enjoy for the next three hours or more.
