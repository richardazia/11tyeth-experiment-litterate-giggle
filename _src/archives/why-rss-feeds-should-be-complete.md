When you're creating web content that's fed please think about those that are reading your feed from a device that is disconnected. here I am on a train and I'm captive to the content that you make available on your feed. Some feeds have the full article but others don't. The result of this has a simple consequence. There is no use for your feed on my mobile device since there is no content. I would thus urge anyone with a feed to make sure to make all content available so that people may access it on the move, especially since Wifi is not yet ubiquitous.
