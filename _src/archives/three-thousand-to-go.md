In three thousand words my first dissertation draft will be ready. This evening I may be able to get up to ten thousand words and from that point on it will be about the re-writing of one section after another until I am happy that I have fit in as much relevant information as possible into the dissertation. It's been great weather in London over the past two days especially. Far fewer planes were flying yesterday, therefore, there were far fewer contrails than usual. It's another beautiful day today and everyone's going to take advantage of this. It's too nice to sit indoors in front of the dissertation when the sun is out. Summer is teasing us too effectively.
