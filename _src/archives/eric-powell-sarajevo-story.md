An interesting look back in to the past. I remember seeing this conflict on television. I know people who covered the story and I've heard about how a colleague gave one person a gameboy when he left Sarajevo. That person called and asked about the individual and that's how I knew of a personal story. One or two segments in this video show the tape to tape editing process. I learned how to edit this way but by the time I worked as an editor everything had moved to non linear editing systems. I'm sure this will bring back memories for a few people.
