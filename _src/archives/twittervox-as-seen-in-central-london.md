The film Juno was screened to a crowd of bloggers of which both Loudmouthman and I were part of. As a result it gave us the perfect opportunity to do a twittervox. The video can be found [here](http://www.main-vision.com/video/detail.php?c=2&i=a2a3b9448b82c14634c5503ce020f79e969fc6a8) for [direct download](http://www.main-vision.com/video/download.php?c=2&i=a2a3b9448b82c14634c5503ce020f79e969fc6a8&e=.mov). After meeting with Nik Butler and others for the screening of the film Juno several tweeters meet up at the Union bar to discuss both the film and other topics Those present were danacea of Forbidden Planet, Loudmouthman of Loudmouthman.com, Rupert Howe, Beth, Robert Croma, Sizemore, Jess and many more. I will admit to liking the response I have had so far from my fellow seesmicers and twitter users. It was a good night and I look forward to more of them in the near future.
