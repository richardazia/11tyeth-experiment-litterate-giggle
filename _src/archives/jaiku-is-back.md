Remember Jaiku? it's that site that was compared to twitter and behaved like friendfeed before friendfeed existed. Over the last two days activity has increased on that site as at least twenty people go back to communicating on the site. It's a throw back to a community that had been quite lively. Online communities are funny in the way they cluster back to a place where they used to be. It's like a migration but of an electronic kind. Does this mean I'll have to pull out the N95 and use jaiku from there? We'll have to see.
