I have used Twitter almost every single day since I created my first account in 2006. During this time I have met a lot of people, gone to a lot of events, learned a lot and been part of communities. The decision to take a break is not an easy one to make, because it involves losing touch with a community. It involves leaving a social network at the moment when you're following and conversing with more people.

I feel obligated to take a break for two main reasons. The first is that it makes rational sense to leave social networks when their ownership and morality swing to the Far Right. I don't want to read news by Far Right newspapers, watch their news, listen to their shows, or be part of their social networks.

Theoretically I could simply shrink the number of people I follow and keep my tweets private, and I'd be happy with that. The real reason I want to take a twitter break is that I don't want Musk to win. I don't want him to be able to tweet "oh look, the servers are under pressure" and having leading poll questions that provide false justification for immoral points of view.

From a European perspective we cannot continue to use an app where disinformation is seen as free speech. We cannot be on a social network where the mainstream media, despite their Right Wing ownership in many cases, is denigrated and where he wants "citizen" journalism to thrive.

"So it’s perhaps no surprise that Musk, a billionaire businessman, [went off on Apple](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-11-28/musk-says-that-apple-has-mostly-stopped-advertising-on-twitter) this past week. He understands that the iPhone maker is an impediment to his financial goals." [source](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2022-12-04/why-apple-s-aapl-tim-cook-and-elon-musk-avoided-war-over-twitter-lb9h6r0f).

If I stop using Twitter, it is because those in charge at the moment go against sense of ethics and morality. I don't want to be part of a network where people are brainwashed and misled. and where mob mentality is encouraged, rather than rational reason and thought.

Twitter should never have had an IPO. It should never have agreed to being sold, as it enriched greedy people, but with a cost to society at large. It should have become a non profit organisation, working as a medium by which for people to communicate with each other globally, where morality and ethics were prioritised, where rational, decent people made decisions.

We have Mastodon now, and with time Mastodon will be as vibrant as Twitter, but for now using Mastodon means being isolated from a community we enjoy, meeting in a place we no longer want to go to.

And finally, I don't want Twitter to go away. I want user engagement to drop long enough for Musk to rethink his political lean long enough for twitter to become a place for good, once more.
