[Quotably](http://www.quotably.com/) is a new service that allows you to easily follow people's conversations by typing in their username. It displays the most recent conversations and shows the original post as well as the discussions that have occured as a result. It appears to work by taking the most recent @ reply from one person to another and displaying. Here are a few examples: [Warzabidul](http://www.quotably.com/warzabidul) [Jeff Pulver](http://www.quotably.com/jeffpulver) [Fred2baro](http://www.quotably.com/fred2baro) These are examples where you can see a lot of conversation because these users are active in their responses with those following them. Take a look at certain people's threads and you see that there's an initial post but no response to the response. It's quite funny to observe.
