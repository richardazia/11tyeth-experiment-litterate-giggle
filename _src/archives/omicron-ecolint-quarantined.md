So far we have read a lot of articles saying that Omicron could be mild but as of this evening it is being treated as highly contagious. 2000 people, 1600 children and 400 staff are quarantined by decision of Vaud and Geneva.

It would see that the newest variant is serious enough to quarantine an entire school with multiple campuses. We have to see whether this attitude lasts or whether it is short lived.
