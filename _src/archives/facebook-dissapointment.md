What makes a professional camera professional? Direct access to all of the functions without going through ten sub-menus simply to adjust the sound level or open up the iris. What was great about Facebook. Everything was available on sight, not hidden away in sub-menu. They decided overnight to "simplify" the look but what they've done is forced me to think about the logical place for something to be and hoping I'm right. I wish they hadn't changed something that was working so well for me. Facebook, why change something that works so well. Why this obsession with sub-menus?
