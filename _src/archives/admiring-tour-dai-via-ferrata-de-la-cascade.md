The weather was clear so I was admiring the Tour D'AÃ¯ from the [Via Ferrata de La Cascade](http://www.diablerets.ch/fr/ete/sports-et-loisirs/viaferrata). I was in Les Diablerets as I am one of the volunteers at the FIFAD film festival.Â I turned up three hours before I was needed and as I had all my climbing gear, except the pulley for the tyrollean in the car I drive I was able to put on my climbing gear and go for an individual climb of the Via Ferrata. The weather was nice, the temperature was comfortable and the via ferrata was quiet. Aside from two guys climbing one of the climbing routes I was alone. I prefer to climb with others. \[caption id="attachment\_3232" align="aligncenter" width="576"\][![Via Ferrata de La Cascade](http://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/P1060784-576x1024.jpg)](http://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/P1060784.jpg) Via Ferrata de La Cascade\[/caption\] Via ferrata alone are fun because you go at your speed. There is no need to wait for anyone or rush to keep up. I enjoyed how clear the landscape was. I looked across the valley and I could clearly see the Tour D'AÃ¯ and the peak next to it. It is the first time that I notice so clearly the other Via Ferrata. \[caption id="attachment\_3233" align="aligncenter" width="660"\][![The Tour D'aÃ¯ seen from Les Diablerets](http://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/P1060770-1024x576.jpg)](http://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/P1060770.jpg) The Tour D'aÃ¯ seen from Les Diablerets\[/caption\] When you climb the Tour D'aÃ¯ via ferrata you climb from the other side and go to the summit of the peak on the left. When you walk down you walk on that green part. The trail is an alpine one, for experienced hikers. You see that there is quite a drop if you make a mistake. You normally see this mountain from the Leysin side. \[caption id="attachment\_3234" align="aligncenter" width="660"\][![The Tour D'aÃ¯ seen from Les Diablerets](http://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/P1060774-1024x576.jpg)](http://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/P1060774.jpg) The Tour D'aÃ¯ seen from Les Diablerets\[/caption\] This image shows the Tour D'AÃ¯ in relationÂ to other mountains. When youÂ go to Les Diablerets this image will help you locate the peaks. The shape of that mountain is easy to recognise. We will see when I try the [Rocher Jaune](http://www.viaferrata.com/index.php/fr/home-fr-fr/19-via-ferrata-suisse/31-502-via-ferrata-rocher-jaune-les-diablerets-vaud-suisse.html). That via ferrata is higher up starting at 2400 metres and ending at 2450 meters according to one source.
