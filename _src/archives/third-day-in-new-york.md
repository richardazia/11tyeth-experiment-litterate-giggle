Today I'm going to Statten Island in New York. It's the third day I've been here so far and I've already visited the UN, Battery Park, Central Park, Times Square (at night), and other locations. I transited through Amsterdam from London, stopping there for a few hours. The flight was aboard a 777. I watched both Tsotsi and The Devil Wears Prada. I have another seven days here and it should continue being good fun. When I have a little more time I'll add some pictures for people to view
