Cycling is one of the best sports to do during a heatwave because you have a 25 km/h breeze blowing over you, until you stop. If you flee the oven like cities, and head for the woods by a stream, you will feel the coolness provided by nature, rather than air conditioning.

Yesterday I cycled along the lake from Nyon to Geneva. Most people headed to the lake to go for a swim but I don't. I like to avoid crowds, and cycling is one way to do that. As I cycled I felt that I was thirsty and I did drink one water bottle heading to Geneva, and other when riding back.

## The Place Des Nations 'Shower'

This time I did something unique. When I got to Place Des Nations I took a shower, on my bike, under one of the water jets. What struck me is that the water that trickled down my face after that spontaneous shower tasted as if I had just been swimming or diving in the sea. I actually took two showers. The first was with the bike. The second was just in my clothes. 

Not only did I not feel cold, but my clothes were so saturated in water that I thought I might actually feel cold. That fear didn't last long. For the ride back to Nyon I was wearing wet clothes, that as they dried, cooled me off.

## Avoiding Heat stroke

I did this to avoid heat stroke. When I was cycling I felt fine, but at some point I stopped and that's when I could feel the heat radiating towards me. I'm glad I had two 620ml water bottles. They lasted for almost the entire ride.

Children noticed me stand under the water jet. I probably looked like a strange adult cyclist to them. Usually cyclists empty water bottles on their heads. I took it a step further. It makes sense, during a heatwave, to break with social norms.

## The Dogs of the Voie Verte

I cycled through the Bois De Versoix before turning and heading from Sauverny to Grilly, and from Grilly I took the voie verte. I saw two runners but everyone else was walking dogs. The advantage is that it's flat, and it's in the shade, so dogs don't overheat despite the heat.

## And Finally

Yesterday, right from the start I noticed that the wind I was creating by cycling was warm, rather than cooling. That's when you know that the days are getting warm. When the breeze heats, rather than cools. Now is the time when having enough water is essential, and where knowing where water fountains are, is also of use. We are into the summer cycling season now.
