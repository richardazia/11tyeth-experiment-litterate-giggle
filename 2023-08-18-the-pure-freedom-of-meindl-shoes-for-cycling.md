Within the last month I considered updating my cycling shoes, until I saw the price of cycling shoes, even in Decathlon. I saw how expensive they are so I lost interest in them. Barefoot shoes are great because they're light and easy to transport. The problem that I find with 'barefoot' shoes is that I stride, rather than walk. When you stride your heel always smashes into the ground, and with barefoot shoes this can result in heel pain, if, and when, we're not careful. That's why cycling with Barefoot shoes is an interesting idea. 

## For When You Cycle With Others

The advantage of the Meindl Pure Freedom shoes is that they use a BOA style lacing system. You cinch them tight, and uncinch to remove. It takes seconds to put them on and remove. When cycling they are comfortable. I completely forgot I was wearing them. I like wearing clipped in shoes when I'm riding by myself, or with people who are also clipped in to their bikes. When I'm riding with others I find that normal shoes are better. You can stop for a coffee, or walk to take pictures of the landscape in comfort, without going "clac, clac, clac". The other advantage is that if you're going for a bike ride, by car, you don't need to carry two or three pairs of shoes. One is enough. 

## For When You're doing a Steep Climb

Several times I cycled up steep climbs with clipless shoes. When you're on a 20Â° slope and you want to stop, but you're moving so slowly that you don't have time to unclip, being clipped in sucks. You're stuck having to continue, until it flattens. Sometimes that can be several minutes later. The other challenge is when you're starting up again. At this point you have the opposite problem. You want to clip in, before you fall sideways. That's why I was tempted to get flat pedals. When you're wearing normal shoes you can stop and start with ease. Today was a good example of that. I had to stop at a train crossing to wait for a train to pass. With clipless pedals it would have been a nuissance. With normal pedals and barefoot shoes it's easy. 

## Broadening the Use Case

Normal shoes are big, heavy and have shoelaces that can get trapped in the chain system. Barefoot shoes are minimal, light and optimal for when the front of the foot comes into contact with surfaces, rather than the heel. They are ideally suited to cycling. One of my longest rides this year was with Vapor Gloves but I found that they were just a little too minimal for cycling. For the trip from Geneva to Nyon my feet were tired due to the lack of support. The Pure Freedom shoes offer more support. Cycling with them around the Lac De Joux felt fine. It's only when you walk around before and after the ride that you remember that you're wearing minimal shoes. 

## And Finally

Meindl Pure Freedom shoes are not marketed as cycling shoes, or hiking shoes. They're marketed as backup shoes. Shoes that you take on a hike, instead of crocs, for when you're in a town, on a train, or driving to and from where you're hiking. I worry that heel strikes in these shoes are too hard for 10-12 kilometres walking at striding pace. Most cycling shoes have BOA laces so it made sense for me to test them cycling today. My experiment was a success.
