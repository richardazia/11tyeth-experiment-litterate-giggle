Yesterday Twitter decided to re-brand as X. X.com redirects to Twitter.com. Within the next few days, weeks, months twitter will change its name and brand, and the URLs will be wrong. All twitter links, all embedded tweets, everything will become dead links. When we look for something on Twitter, we will be redirected to X. 

## The Podcast Legacy

Every single website, every single CMS, every Static Website, everything, will have to be re-written to point to the new domain name. Plenty of content will not be updated and will be a reminder of the past. 

I'm thinking of all the podcast episodes and conversations that speak about Twitter, all the guests that mention their Twitter accounts. All of those "where can we find you?", "where can we follow you" will turn to nothing. Suddenly mentioning Twitter accounts will be a reminder of the past.

## Happy to Have Broken From Twitter

I am happy that I already broke my ties with Twitter, because this change would make me really sad. It's the end of a culture, it's the end of an era. It's the end of an important part of web history. Musk has destroyed an important cultural symbol. "Pour des Prunes", as the french would say. "For nothing, as the English would say.

## Don't Complain

More than once I have been told not to complain, to filter what I don't like, and just to accept what I can't change. Yesterday I was unhappy about a pop up that appeared twice, trying to teach me how to use Mastodon. I expressed my disgust, and was told not to complain. The thing is, I am a heavy social media user, so I am more sensitive to toxic changes, on social networks than most, because I live and breath these networks.

## Hashtags

I complain about hashtags because I have seen them destroy conversations on twitter, and undermine communities. If people had listened, Twitter might not have become such a toxic place.

I am happy to see that you can go for toots, before seeing hashtags being used, and that's great, because the moment hashtags saturate timelines is the moment the community will be dead, and the time to move on will have come. 

## Kbin

Yesterday I decided to take a break from the Fediverse and went to Kbin but all I saw in the threadiverse were people complaining about Spez and reddit. If those users could, I know that they would return to reddit, because that is their home. They're expats, refugees. They moved because staying put was no longer possible.

I have been complaining about Twitter since Jaiku was around, but the critical mass were on Twitter so I had no choice. Google + was great, but it was destroyed by Google because they destroy anything that is niche, rather than mass appeal. 

## Slow to Adapt

It's interesting that the Web is so slow to adopt to the new social networks. I don't see that many sites that encourage people to add Mastodon, Kbin, Lemmy or Firefish accounts. They're sticking with Twitter and Reddit, despite the clear shift by an active part of the social web, from one set of platforms to the next. 

## Frozen in Time

I was looking at one of my twitter accounts and it has been frozen in time. The last post that was sent from my Wordpress Blog marks the end of Jetpack talking with Twitter. That account is now frozen in history. Until I update a post. 

## Worth Returning?

I considered returning to Twitter yesterday, because it's easy to use, smooth and fast compared to fediverse instances. The problem is that every little change Musk makes, to destroy Twitter, is heartbreaking, if you have good memories of the old Twitter.

I left Twitter because I didn't want ads to be injected every four posts, into my stream. I left Twitter because I don't want an algorithm to choose what I see, rather than me. I don't want to be on a site that I consider, is run by a morally bankrupt individual.

## And Finally

Twitter has been mentioned in blog posts and podcasts for more than a decade. It has been mentioned in almost every podcast too. By dumping Twitter as a name X is destroying its own legacy. How many people will type x.com rather than Twitter.com? X is not a good brand name. X is just a letter, nothing more. Will people be x-ing? If they're exing are they crossing? "Are you going to X that later"? X is having an x-istential crisis.
