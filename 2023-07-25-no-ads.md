With the change in name from Twitter to X, and with the destruction of a recognisable brand mentioned in tens of thousands of podcasts, podcasts, episodes and millions of web pages I was curious to see how Twitter was, with the new logo. It took more than 24 hours to change the favicon, and whilst x.com does redirect to Twitter, it does not do anything else than redirect to Twitter.com. You can't see your x posts there.

## A Twitter X Roads - Twitter at a Cross Roads

I was web disaster tourism yesterday and today. I was going over to Twitter to gawk, and stare, at the app formerly known as Twitter, being disfigured to please the ego of a billionaire. One of the things that surprises me is that people are still using Twitter. I stopped months ago, by now, and I don't miss it. The community that I was going for either left, before Musk, or after he transformed the site. I noticed that at least one website called it the Zombie network.

## Social Networks Without Ads

When you get used to the Fediverse, you get used to timelines without ads. You get used to timelines without algorithms choosing what you do or do not see. You see things as they are posted, and in conversation order. Without ads life is nicer.

A few days ago I noticed that a fediverse instance raised two thirds more than it needed to break even. This is good news for that instance as this means it can expand, if and when required, and it can continue for two more years, if not.

## And Finally

I am happy I gave up on Twitter weeks ago, because if I had not I would find current developments depressing. Instead I'm looking out of curiousity, and I'm surprised to see that people are still using Twitter, despite the high probability that the site we loved to hate, is on borrowed time. I'm just a web disaster tourist, looking at the site, before it is left for the [way back machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20060930214639/http://twitter.com/) to remember.
