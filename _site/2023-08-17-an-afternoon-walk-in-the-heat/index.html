    <h1>Richard's 11ty Experiment</h1>
    <h2>An Afternoon Walk in the Heat</title></h2>
    <p><a href="../">back</a></p>

    <p>Yesterday I went for a walk with a Garmin Etrex 32 that was sometimes in my hands and at other times in my pocket. I could have been hands three with a GPS watch but it's good to play with a variety of devices. I chose the Etrex because it was paired with the Tempe thermometer.
The Thermometer was in my backpack, in the top pocket. I knew that the air temperature would be around 30°c but I wanted to see what the &quot;felt&quot; temperature would be. As I left home the thermometer indicated 28°c before climbing to a maximum of 45°c and an average of 38°c.

I felt fine during this walk. I set off with a 600ml water bottle and for the first half of the walk I didn't drink because I wasn't thirsty. By the time I did start drinking my water it was warm.</p>
<h2>Walking to Fountains</h2>
<p>The advantage of walking the same routes every day for years in a row, is that you learn where the water points are, even in a drought, and even when they turn off most of the fountains. I know of two fountains with drinking water. One of them is by a motorway stop, near a river. It's a fountain that is near a composting place for garden rubbish.
The second water fountain is down the road from Celigny, on a sleep climb, or descent, depending on your direction of travel. The flow from both of these fountains is slow, but on a hot day, when you're out of water, they're fine.
Other fountains run all year round but they have one serious flaw. They're not &quot;potable&quot;. They are not certified &quot;safe&quot; for drinking. It's a shame that they don't tell us what makes these fountains unsafe, because If I knew then I could use one of my water filters to make them safe. I am not playing with water filters to clean water, when I don't know what I want to remove from it.
The Essential Hat
I never leave home without a hat. In winter it keeps me warm, but in summer it's to protect me from the sun. If I went for a walk, in conditions like the forecast heatwave, without a hat, then my hair, and head would overheat with speed. My head would have heated to 45°c yesterday, if I had not worn a hat, or been ready with drinking water. I drank 400 to 500ml on the way out. When I was on the return part of the walk I refilled my water bottle, and drank another 600ml.
Without a hat and water I would get heat stroke.</p>
<h2>The New Normal</h2>
<p>[caption id=&quot;attachment_10600&quot; align=&quot;alignnone&quot; width=&quot;300&quot;]<a href="https://blog.main-vision.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/IMG_3001-scaled.jpg"><img src="https://blog.main-vision.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/IMG_3001-300x225.jpg" alt="Dry fields and Potato harvesting" width="300" height="225" class="size-medium wp-image-10600" /></a> Dry fields and Potato harvesting[/caption]
A few years ago I found it nice, and luxurious to get 30°c heat in Switzerland. Occassionaly, when I was climbing, it would get to 40°c by the cliff face. When I had a broken arm I was walking in 37°c heat, and did so for the last few years. When I have a hat, and water, heat doesn't bother me, especially in the countryside
Heat Islands
I have been cycling on high temperature days and as long as I was riding, with the breeze blowing over me, I was fine. It's when I stopped, especially in the ovens of Geneva, and other towns, that I felt myself cook. Heat from the sun is one thing. Heat radiating from cement, tarmac and buildings is quite another.
The coolest place I often encounter is forests through which a stream runs. Usually the contrast between the two is clear and distinct. If you're too warm, on a warm day, head to a forest stream and you'll recover.</p>
<h2>Freedom From Dogs</h2>
<p>One of the nicest feature of heatwaves is that the weather is too warm for dogs, so dogs stay indoors, where it's cooler. I have a fear of dogs, and when the heat waves hit I feel good, because I do not need to worry about encountering dog walkers. I can enjoy my walks fully.</p>
<h2>And Finally</h2>
<p>For several summers my apartment was so warm that I was soaked, just sitting, doing nothing, and stepping outside into the heat, was actually an opportunity to cool down. As long as I have a hat, and water, I'm fine with the heat. Take away my hat, and water, and I will be like everyone else.
Remember, if you're too warm indoors, open a window to the outside, and the door from your room to the hallway. Create a breeze, and it will keep you cool.</p>
