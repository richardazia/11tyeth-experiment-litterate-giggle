    <h1>Richard's 11ty Experiment</h1>
    <h2>Cycling With Different Levels of Fitness</title></h2>
    <p><a href="../">back</a></p>

    <p>Originally I wanted to write about following route 50 from one village to Romainmôtier. I changed my mind as I createdd thetitle for this post.
Yesterday I cycled with two people on electric bikes on my normal bike. I didn't feel that I was making that great an effort, especially since I was cycling at a relatively slow speed compared to usual. I actually felt that I was taking it easy.</p>
<h2>Calories Burned</h2>
<p>It's when I looked at calories burned that I realised that what felt like an easy ride to me, was actually a huge effort. It didn't feel that way to me, because it is normal for me to make such an effort, and I usually push myself when I ride alone.</p>
<h2>Three Times More Calories</h2>
<p>By riding with people with electric bikes I felt that I was having a relatively easy day. I burned three times more calories than them. It shows to what extent being fit affects how we perceive effort, but also how much energy electric bikes save.</p>
<h2>Perfectly Within My Comfort Zone</h2>
<p>I was surprised by the huge difference in calories burned because I felt comfortable. I didn't feel that I was struggling to keep pace with the bikes, or struggling on hills whilst they glided with ease. That's the beauty of cycling a lot. Effort becomes ordinary, and fitness makes electric bikes harder to justify. Why get an electric bike when you can cycle with people with electric bikes and keep up?</p>
<h2>Cyclists and Non Cyclists Riding Together</h2>
<p>There are two types of people. Those that invests hundreds of hours over several years to boost their cycling fitness, and those that use electric bikes, to keep up with those with experience. I would argue that the strength of the electric bike is two-fold. The first is that it encourages non cyclists to cycle and experience the pleasure of getting from A to B under their own steam, but the second is that electric bikes allow non cyclists to ride with cyclists, and get a taste of what we enjoy.</p>
<h2>Visiting Romainmôtier by bike</h2>
<p>Romainmôtier is a nice destination to cycle to. The road takes you through a nice quiet road in the forest. The woods are the Bois De Ferreyres. The route that I took was undulating, with some climbing and some descending, but these ondulations are not extreme like cycling up to La Dôle or up to La Rippe, so manageable.</p>
<h2>Cycling Destination</h2>
<p>Quite a few people cycled to Romainmôtier and I noticed that a few went into the grounds of the Abbaye and rested their bikes against the wall, before having a drink. By taking the bike parking is simplified, but as well as parking being simplified, you get to experience the landscape first hand. You're faster than a hiker, but still get to experience the winding roads, the ups, the downs, and the freedom to stop with the bike, more conveniently than with a car.</p>
<h2>Recommendation</h2>
<p>If you are not a confident cyclist, and don't want to spend hundreds of hours getting fit, then electric bikes are a fantastic short cut because they give you the freedom to explore, without the dread of having to get back, despite being knackered. ELectric bikes are more forgiving than cycling without a motor. With an electric bike you just ask for more assistance and you're comfortable.</p>
