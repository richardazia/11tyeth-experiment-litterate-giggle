Recently I started using [feedly](http://www.feedly.com) which is a great tool for managing rss feeds and content into an easy to view form. Connecting with google reader, friendfeed and a number of other surfaces it provides you with three principle displays for viewing the content you have selected to have aggregated. The first display shows your content by theme. In my case these themes are social media, video, technology, explore, and of course my own content output, to some degree. From this display I can quickly see a number of topics. The second display is named digest. It displays three of the top unread stories with the title and a quick description of the articles in each category. You can cycle through these articles using the ever popular J and K keys, j for going back, K for going forwards. A counter tells you how many items are left for each category. The list view gives you a quick headline for every blog post. It's a quick way to go through your rss feeds. The articles expand to their full length once they have been selected. \[caption id="attachment\_1010" align="aligncenter" width="307" caption="Conversation tracking according to article"\][![Conversation tracking according to article](http://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/picture-9.png "The most interesting feature")](http://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/picture-9.png)\[/caption\] Above is what I think is the most interesting feature of all. It's a demonstration of how feedly is integrated into your every day browsing. Anytime you go to a blog you're made aware of the conversation that is taking place and how active it is. You may also share that content to a number of platforms, from google reader to friendfeed, twitter and more to add. You can add a note to explain why you think that blog post is relevant to your readers. Of course the reason I love this application, requiring firefox, so much is that it allows for the entire world wide web to be something your share with those who are interested in where your attention is being drawn. It syncs with google reader, integrates with friendeed and just provides a great all round user experience. I strongly recommend using it.
