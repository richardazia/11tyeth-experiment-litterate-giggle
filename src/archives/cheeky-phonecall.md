I have a deep and sincere hate for spammers, whether in forum comments, spam e-mails, spam websites or sales phone calls. It's only 950GMT and already I've received a phone call from 02920368792 trying to get me to change from one phone network to another. The problem is that there's no proof that the person is who they claim they are. They call from a noisy room and they're disturbing my peace and quiet. If anyone sees this number reject the phone call. If I want to upgrade my contract, if I want to change provider, if I want to improve something then I've got the world wide web and all the phone network websites several hundredths of a second away so why would I want some salesperson calling me. No way am I going to accept anything that someone attempts to sell by phone.
