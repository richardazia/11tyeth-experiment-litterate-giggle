Today's news is as follows. Having seen that [Bill Palmer](http://twitter.com/billpalmer) of the [Iprong podcast](http://www.iprong.com/) and website would add the 300th friend on Facebook I decided I would take this opportunity to add him. His podcast is "for the ipod generation so take the time to listen to it. It's mainly about iphones and ipods but mixes in quite a few artists in the process. The second event was becoming the 3000th person to use [twittermail](http://twittermail.com/). I saw someone mention that they were up to three thousand and I decided to be the 3000th. Now that's done it's great. It's twice as great since it helps to emphasise that I have reached over three thousand tweets since becoming a twitter member. The last bit of news is that it's [blog action day](http://blogactionday.org/) tomorrow. The topic is going to be the environment so right anything with an environmental conscience for your blog and share it with the world. That's it for tonight.
