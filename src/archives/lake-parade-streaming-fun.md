Whilst a friend was filming with a high speed camera i was streaming the event live from my phone via Qik. I noticed they improved a couple of important things. The first is that video files are now saved and readable without conversion. The second fact is that you now have an RSS feed, makes aggregation easier. I've added two or three of those feeds to itunes so the content can be accessed more easily.       And there are a few more on Qik which I'll let you get to yourself.
