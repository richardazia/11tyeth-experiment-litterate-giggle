In some cities you see a strange set of creatures and the selfie stick cutter is there to resolve this issue. PeopleÂ carry long poles at the end of which they stick their camera. They look at the phone held at a safe distance and smile, do victory symbols and other such gestures. These sticks would be really interesting if they were used to provide people with interesting images. Instead they are used to take pictures in interesting places with ordinary people in front. As a camera operator I photograph landscapes or monuments. It is an old fashioned habit. The selfie stick is so endemic to some parts of the world by now that pranksters run around and cut people's selfie sticks with the phone still attached. You can watch as dozens of phones fall to the ground in this video. Mobile phone repair shops must really enjoy watching this video. Look at all the work they will soon have. I think that this video is meant to be seen as a joke but can you imagine how much anger such an action would generate. Can you imagine how fast you would have to run away from some of these people. You see these people look surprised and in some cases betrayed. They have a quarter of a million views so far and it will grow from tomorrow onwards, as people in offices share the video with their friends and colleagues. Maybe by next week it will have more than a million views. Selfie sticks are popular and so are pranks. With the money they could make from monetising this video they could compensate the people whose screens they broke. \[caption id="attachment\_3349" align="aligncenter" width="300"\][![The story is not viral yet](http://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Screen-Shot-2016-09-04-at-14.36.16-300x211.png)](http://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Screen-Shot-2016-09-04-at-14.36.16.png) The story is not viral yet\[/caption\] Selfie sticks do have one practical purpose. You can fix 360 cameras to them and take pictures without the giant index finger getting in the way. That is how I use one. You can get them for cheap from certain types of shops. You do not need to spend 29 euros.
