(Facebook as of this morning) Reliability is the single most important thing for a website. If, as they suggest, facebook is down for a few hours then that is demonstrating one of the key reasons why my web presence is spread across so many different sites on the World Wide Web. The Internet (network of networks) was built for redundancy therefore any form of downtime is unacceptable. In other news I'm back in London with the need to do more looking for work. Whilst in Switzerland I listened to a group of people working within the industry give advice to another person and in so doing there are a few recommediations I should make sure to apply them to my own efforts.
