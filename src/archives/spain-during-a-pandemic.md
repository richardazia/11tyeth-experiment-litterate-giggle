People wear masks as they walk and do waiters. This is nice. It’s nice to see people wearing masks during a pandemic. It’s nice not to feel like an outlier. It’s nice not to feel eccentric for mask wearing.

I went for my first swim in at least two years. I didn’t go in the sea but in a pool. I haven’t forgotten how to swim despite not swimming for years.

I feel tired from yesterday’s drive but by tomorrow or the next day I should have recovered and then I can try something different.
