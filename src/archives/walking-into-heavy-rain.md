Sometimes you end up walking into heavy rain. That's what I did today. I looked at the weather and because it was meant to get better over the coming days I assumed that this evening it would get better. Instead, as I walked it started to rain a little more, and then a little harder, and eventually quite a bit harder. Did I get wet beyond the top layer? Nope, but my beanie got a little wet, as did my fleece. My shoes on the other hand were clean, thanks to the flow of water.

I was lucky today, because if I had set off a little later then I would have been soaked by the time I got home. I skirted the rain by an amusing amount. I could have been drenched if I had set off later. I timed my walk to avoid the sunset, so that would have helped me avoid the rain anyway. I don't want to walk at night.

Today I walked over 18,000 steps, according to the [Casio](https://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/the-casio-gbd-200-1/), 8800 in the morning, and another ten thousand in the evening. In the evening, as the rain started, I decided to run for one kilometre. I tracked it with the Garmin instinct and the Casio. There was no reason to track with both, except that I was curious to see the result. If you want running time step count and distance then the [Casio GBD-200](https://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/the-casio-gbd-200-1/) is fine. If you want cadence, heart rate zones, and other data then keep with the Garmin Instinct. To boot, with the Garmin instinct you get to check the weather first, and you might not be caught out, as I was.

And Finally
-----------

I was surprised that the [Casio GBD-200](https://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/the-casio-gbd-200-1/) doesn't allow you to select which sport you're doing. If you track cycling then you will screw up the data, and if you track walking you will use the watch for many more hours per week than it is planned for. I am not often confused about how I feel about a device. I wish the casio would do more, but at the same time I bought it because it does less. I'm all the more confused because according to the Apple Fitness app I stood, moved and exercised enough and now I don't know what the source for the data was. I need to keep experimenting.
