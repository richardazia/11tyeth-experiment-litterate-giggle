I've just spent at least two hours playing around with drupal. I was working on bit by bit and actually had a case where I had to RTFM. Over the past few hours, I was trying to understand why I couldn't place the blocks where I wanted. Finally, I found out. I had forgotten to upload the themes folder therefore no content was uploaded. It's a Content management system, developed so that people may contribute new content without the hassle of uploading HTML files. I've used a few but this is the best implementation so far. So far my impressions are good. I'm running version 5.1 of Drupal, the most recent one. It's got quite a good number of features and looks really flexible so I may have quite a bit of fun with it. At the moment drupal is not available for direct viewing by people visiting my page but as I get it to behave as I want it to I may bring it forward. As a result, I may finally bring my website into the web 2.0 world. It will be database driven from this point forward rather than static pages as it had been till then. I'm happy with it. Time to continue playing with it.
