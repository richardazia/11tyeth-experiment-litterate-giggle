"If you were young and healthy and if they needed labour then you were selected as slave labour. You would have suffered a slow death rather than a fast one". This soundbite is 13 minutes in. In this documentary a concentration camp survivor takes two girls who are the age she was when she arrived through the camp and tells them about her experiences. We owe it to future generations to keep re-sharing these accounts and documentaries to prevent such actions from ever happening again. I have just finished watching the documentary and I feel almost shell shocked. I have been to the camp and I have read about the topic. I have also watched a number of topics on this topic. What makes this the most poignant documentary is that this woman, this grandmother of eight is making sure that future generations are aware of what Auschwitz life was like. She tells us about survival.
