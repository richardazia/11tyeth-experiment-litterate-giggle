For those of you with good data packages an application that could be a lot of fun is youtube on the n95. I was out and about and decided to check the youtube site and I was given the option to download their beta. I managed to play vides but I had no sound. What they offer are: - upload your videos from the phone - watch your friends' videos - view relatd videos - view received videos - search for content. In other words you can do everything you'd want to from the n95 that you'd do from a computer. It does look like an interesting application although unless you've got wifi this is a very expensive gimmick. It's nice to try nonetheless. Let me know if you try it and tell me what you think of it.
