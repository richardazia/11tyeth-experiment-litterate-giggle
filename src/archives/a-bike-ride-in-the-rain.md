My fingers went numb with cold during today’s bike ride. I saw that there was a chance of rain but I went anyway. I went for a simple reason. Some people in an apartment next door were banging on walls, and the noise is unpleasant. The noise is so unpleasant that the idea of cycling in the cold rain was more appealing than listening to that noise. 

When I started the ride I wore my rain clothes. I also wore gloves. I wish I had at least one extra glove layer to protect me further. I think the mixture of rain and cold got through the gloves to my fingers. For the entire ride I questioned whether to turn back and give up on the day’s ride. I didn’t. I toughed it out. 

I rode up towards Gingins along the farm roads, before going across towards La Rippe. I didn’t go to La Rippe because of the downhill from La Rippe to Crassier. On a rainy day and with the brakes I have I prefer not to run that risk. The brakes were less responsive than usual. From Crassier I went across the Voie Verte to Divonne, and from Divonne down towards Mies, and from there back towards Nyon. 

You know how Cousteau always wore his trademark red hat. I feel the need to do the same, but with another hat. I got chilled during my bike ride and now I need to eat a good lunch, and let my body warm up again. This ride has chilled my core. 

Yesterday it was raining too, so I tested to see whether my devices worked with Zwift. They do. I rode for about 20-30 minutes before stopping and deciding to go for a proper walk, despite the risk of rain. The desire to go outdoors is strong. Even on rainy days I want to go outdoors. For once I rode in the rain.
