One of the best nights to go out on at the moment is Monday night because that's the night when most friends are out in the same place. Last night I was at the student yet again and I took 73 pictures of which one I'm afraid I'd prefer never to look at. Some of those pictures are really amusing and the expressions are great. I'm going to keep those private, simply for my friends to view. They're on my phone, Facebook, and my iPod. They're a collection of memories for when university is finished and that what remains are memories. What made last night interesting as: 1) lollipops, two girls I know had a lollipop fight, a sticky affair 2)Many photographs of friends 3) Many conversations 4) the cold Of course, the night had started differently. It started when I went to watch some friends act in the show Howard Katz. A friend was in the play from the first to last scene, that's 110 pages. There were some great moments and the principal actor has great stage presence and projects his voice well. I enjoyed the play because I allowed myself to be transported into the moment. It's a shame that it's the last play I go to, produced by this university.
