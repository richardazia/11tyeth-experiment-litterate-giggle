I really like this documentary series about Edwardian Farming. it is a fly on the wall documentary following three people through a year on an edwardian farm close to Dartmoor. They experiment with market farming, food preparation of the time, trout farming and so much more. It is relaxing and without an over-enthusiastic announcer/narration. It's a fascinating glimpse at a way of life that those who remember it is becoming dead rather than living history. The BBC excel at this type of content and this is what they should focus on producing more of.
