I like smaller and smaller machines. I'm now enjoying the use of an eeepc, the 1000hg. It has inbuilt 3g modem and a 4.5hr battery life. It's a nice change to use a small laptop because it does the basic things. It allows me to tweet, read e-mail and fail at Nanowrimo. The keyboard is fast for typing. I was able to type over 20,000 words without finding the keyboard to be a hindrance. It's not the smallest of keyboards, nor the biggest, but it does fit my fingers perfectly. The screen is fine most of the time. It is slightly too small for a few web apps and programs. A few times I've gone to a page or used a program which could not cope with the vertical resolution of such a screen. As a result I do need to think about which applications and websites I visit. I also tested seesmic for windows on this machine and that worked well. No crashes, no slowing down the system. I had it running for over 24hrs in between sleep modes and such without the hint of a problem. So far I like the small laptop. It hasn't fallen into a corner like the 900. This one has actually been used. We'll see when I feel the need for a larger machine once more. For now though this is fine.
