I listen to a lot of current affairs programs but occasionaly I enjoy listening to more light hearted podcasts. Over the past two or three days I have been listening to John Foster's [Beerschool](http://www.beerschool.com). This is a podcast aimed at those who want to learn to appreciate more than one type of beer. He also jokes that "the best part about beerschool is of course the homework" which consists in drinking beer. It covers the San Francisco area speaking about a variety of beers and the breweries and bars where they are served. It's a great resource for those who may drop by that part of the world and want to experience that aspect of the culture. Aside from this point I was recently mentioned in their podcast for a comment I wrote about the "Rockstar" program. I was quite amused by this.
