Sukhjit: For the past three or four days I have been watching hours of documentaries. They have nothing about celebrity, nothing about real market value. They simple provide information about subjects that interest a certain portion of the population. There's an interesting series called Evolve and two subjects were "Skin" and the second was "Gugts". These are topics that may not be interesting because there is a low chance that people would buy them. At the same time it' like video encyclopedias. Rather than look at this information on a page you actually see it. Much as with David attenborough's Life on Earth Series from the 70s I really think there's more to television than mindless entertainment for the masses. I also think that music, games shows and other programs are not the only form of entertainment. In fact that's why I never watched the five channels available in England. Frieda: There' a lot that can be done when you've got unlimited airtime, as is the case on the web. They might as well take advantage of that and produce some original content.

It was like watching TV which I hardly ever do! You are right on!

I just tweeted you a cryptic comment after reading this post and realized I should just leave a comment on your site. What you are asking of youtube live and other video venues is right on the money! But the disconnect, I think, is in how do these companies/networks make money. A comfortable and proven model (old school) is to affiliate with a star or entertainer. On the flip side, YouTube has grown by allowing everyday people to share real life. But as you probably know it's still confusing how these things will lead to profit. I have not seen the program you're talking about but I do recognize the trend. It's a traditional media model...too bad. I have more to say, Richard, but it is 1:30AM, I'm tired and my brain is not working as well as it should. I am fascinated by this topic and wonder the same things you are asking. Hope we can chat about this another time.
