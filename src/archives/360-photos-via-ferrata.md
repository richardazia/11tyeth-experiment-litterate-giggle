Yesterday I was up above Leysin climbing the Tour D'AÃ¯ via Ferrata. It was an opportunity for me to take 360 photos of Via Ferrata. The beauty of panoramic pictures is that they provide you 360Â° of vision both vertically and horizontally. It means that you can get a sense of size and scale. You can look at the person exploring the via ferrata and how precarious their situation is as easily as you can admire the beauty of the landscape. \[vrview img="http://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/R0011307\_20160701130638.jpg" pimg="http://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/R0011307\_20160701130638.jpg" width="500" height="400" \] Another great aspect to 360Â° photos is that you can show specific bits of via ferrata and show where the challenging bits are. "Here is where the via ferrata is overhanging" so that you can assess whether you have the strength and courage to try that section or "Here is how high up you are" and so you get a sense of whether you would be paralysed with fear or enjoy yourself. \[vrview img="http://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/R0011321\_20160701133926.jpg" pimg="http://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/R0011321\_20160701133926.jpg" width="500" height="400" \] Most via ferrata are like the one that you see in these images. You have what I call staples, pedals and occasionally direct contact with the rocks. In other places you have spikes or you have to pull yourself up along the cable. With these images you see how well equipped the via ferrata is and you are not going in to the unknown. This is good when taking less experienced people. A side effect of 360 pictures is that you capture a self portrait of yourself in situ over and over again. It is by nature of the medium rather than desire.
