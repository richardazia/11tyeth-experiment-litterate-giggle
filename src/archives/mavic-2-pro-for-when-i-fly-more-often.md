The Mavic 2 Pro just came out and people are euphoric about the drone because of its one inch sensor, it's ability to zoom and it's omnidirectional systems keeping an eye on the environment below, behind, above and ahead of it. It also has a flying time of 31 minutes. 

I'm happy with the DJI Spark. Last Autumn as the nights shortened and work got in the way of flying the drone I felt disappointed that I would have to suspend the passion whilst waiting for the next summer to arrive. This summer came and it is now approaching an end and I haven't flown as much as I would have expected to. It's partially due to having to get the charger out, charge all the batteries and fly somewhere new that slowed me down. NFZs limit the number of places where you can fly. 

The issue with DJI drones is that whilst they are excellent camera drones they are not as versatile as FPV drones. If you don't have a video project in mind they're limited in scope. 

This being said I did get nice footage of the Swiss flags with vineyards in the background. You can tell how windy the conditions were by how taut the flag is.

I also got footage of golden crops yesterday. I had the sun behind me and I stayed on the grass between the field and a road. You get a nice view of the crops in the foreground and the Mont Blanc and the Alps in the background.
