Today whilst surfing through the webapps I found one that's great for what I do, share video content via the web. I found [Vtap](http://vtap.com/), a video sharing website that allows you to search through, select and stream videos straight through to your iphone or Ipod touch without either converting it to an ipod compatible format or using the youtube website.

For certain videos it gave me a feedreader rather than playing the videos but for those that are already indexed it works well. It's definitely worth a try and it's a taste of the future.
