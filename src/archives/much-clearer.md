I went for a meeting today and the documentary idea is far clearer now than before. Thanks to the help of the tutor I've got a far more focused way of looking at the question I wanted to ask. I still need to write a third draft of the proposal and get it approved. In the meantime I can already start writing the introduction to the dissertation explaining the context and setting the scene for the remainder of the document. Going to be fun from now on.
