[Flight radar 24](http://www.flightradar24.com/ "Flight Radar desktop version") is an iphone app that allows you to see where aircraft are on google maps. It shows the callsign, registration, altitude and a lot more. It is a fun app for plane spotters. \[caption id="attachment\_1326" align="aligncenter" width="200" caption="Planes approaching Geneva airport"\][![Planes approaching Geneva airport](http://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/photo-200x300.png "Planes approaching Geneva airport")](http://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/photo.png)\[/caption\] Sit on a city roof or at the top of a mountain and as you see a plane fly above you you will know where it's coming from and where it's going. Next time I have to pick someone up at the airport I will be using the flight tracker to know exactly where the plane is. Boredom will be of a different type. \[caption id="attachment\_1327" align="aligncenter" width="200" caption="Flight information"\][![Flight information](http://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/photo-1-200x300.png "Flight information")](http://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/photo-1.png)\[/caption\] The information about what the plane is doing is quite complete. The only thing missing would be a live radio feed of the ATC communications.
