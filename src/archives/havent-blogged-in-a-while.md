I haven't blogged in a few months but I have been tweeting, and working full time, and I'm attempting Nanowrimo once again this year. Last year the process was easier as I had a lot of free time. This year I need to make time. I did get to over 20,000 words but inspiration is slower to come. The meetups are still going on. We've had two in Lausanne already, one in Zurich, one in Bern and the next will be in Basel. I think I'll skip Basel as I have some more urgent projects to finish first. Did I mention over 1.3 billion words have been logged for Nanowrimo? That's after 18 days of writing.
