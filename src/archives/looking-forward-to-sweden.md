In about 23 hours I'm going to be ready both physically and mentally for a trip to the city of Malmo in Sweden. There I expect to find a city I have already been to twice in the past. It is there that I may find a cold wind, blankets in the piccolina Piazza... Lilla Torg and enjoy pear cider. I take the tube towards central London and the bus from there to Stansted. I board a plane that will fly for around 1hr and 20 minutes, land in Copenhague, get to the train station, catch the Oresund train across to the city of Malmo and look at the big waves in the sea below the tracks. It's a short enough trip. I haven't spent more than five weeks at a time in the same place since the beginning of the academic year. I love traveling and seeing other countries and their cultures. It may be the last time I drop by for cheap since the friend will be moving from Sweden within a short amount of time. Three nights in Sverige It may be time for me to learn some Swedish other than "what are you doing" or "you are cute" and learn more relevant sentences. Thursday will make these decisions for me.
