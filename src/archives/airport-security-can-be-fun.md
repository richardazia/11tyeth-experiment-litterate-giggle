When you fly a lot you get used to the antics of airport security. Sometimes you see people get angry and flustered by their stuff being searched. Sometimes I've felt that way as well. Today was amusing. My bag went through the x ray machine and since it was so full of books dvd and more they wanted to look inside. No one else was passing through at the time so I joked about how they had to keep busy. One of them joked about having to find something to confiscate to keep himself entertained. Shame I had nothing of interest. I chatted about the DVD in my bag and about a series related to the first one and it was generaly quite friendly. Hey, when you've flown five times in two months you're bound to be more relaxed about certain aspects, especially when you're in no rush because you gave yourself enough time.
