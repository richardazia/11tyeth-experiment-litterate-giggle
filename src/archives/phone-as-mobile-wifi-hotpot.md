Finally I have received the Over the Air (OTA) update from 2.1 to 2.2 for my nexus one. As a result of this my mobile phone can now be used tethered to a computer for internet access or as a wifi hotspot. The WIFI sharing option allows you to use wpa2 PSK encryption. The reason I was so interested in this update is for use with the iPad. I already have two mobile contracts, one through work and the second private. Both of them allow for at least a gigabyte of data per month. With these contracts and tethering I have the ability to download 2 gigabytes of data from anywhere without paying an additional 19CHF per month to swisscom. the next step will be to see by how much my data consumption will go up as a result of this option. At least one side effect is a lot more freedom. Disclaimer, I would add an image if it was easy to get screengrabs with the nexus one but it's not. Google, can we get that built into the system?
