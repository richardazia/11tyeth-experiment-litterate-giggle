The Via Ferrata Jacques Revaclier is located on the Salève a short drive from Vitam Parc and within easy driving distance of Geneva and Nyon. The Via Ferrata requires scrambling over a few metres of rock to get to the start.

This via Ferrata has two parkings. The first of these is for the [Abbaye de Pomier](http://www.chartreuse-de-pomier.fr/) and the second is for the "promeneurs". If the abbaye parking is empty use this one because you may hit the bottom of your car on the dirt track heaving up to the hiking parking.

This via ferrata goes sideways rather than up and requires you to go down and then up, and then across. You walk under the rock formation pictured below and then get to a section where you are more exposed to seeing the landscape and the landscape below. If you're used to via ferrata then this is the moment you will enjoy and if you are new to via ferrata then this is the moment that will either convince you of your love for the sport, or to try something tamer next.

When you get to the end of the via ferrata you will come into a cluster of trees and you are meant to follow the red paint back to the path down. This is not well marked so requires some tracking skills. I created a GPS track of this trip. Keep in mind that later in the season the track should be clearer. At the start of the season teams of volunteers have usually not cleared these paths.

Beginners can try this via ferrata but be aware that the last part may be a challenge for beginners so prepare them for the last section. It's short and easy to surmount but be wary of it.
