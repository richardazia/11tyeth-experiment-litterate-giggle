[The Longest Way 1.0 - walk through China and grow a beard! - TIMELAPSE](http://vimeo.com/4636202) from [Christoph Rehage](http://vimeo.com/bigfatspringroll) on [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com).

The idea of going on a trip that lasts for more than a year is a common one. People go by car, by walking or by foot. In so doing they discover a new side of life that they had not known before. The simpler the mode of transport the cheaper. In this case the traveller produced a timelapse of his hair growing over an extended period. You see not only the distance but also the companions for segments of that trip. It's an interesting idea.
