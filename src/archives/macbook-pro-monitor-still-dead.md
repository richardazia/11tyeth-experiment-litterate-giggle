Over a week later my laptop is still dead. It's the same flaw as two weeks ago. I took it to technicians who did absolutely nothing for my laptop. They didn't even run a diagnostic test to see that anything was wrong. Now I'm still without a laptop and I don't have time to deal with incompetent people. I need someone to recommend some competent people to check my laptop. Think it's the screen that's dead... just head the skype sound... What can I do to fix a dead monitor?
