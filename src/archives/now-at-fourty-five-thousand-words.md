I'm now at fourty five thousand words. I've written those words in just 24 days. That's an average of 1875 per day. I have another 5000 to go and I will have reached the end of this year's nanowrimo and that's when the editing will start. \[caption id="attachment\_837" align="aligncenter" width="500" caption="Almost at the end"\][![Almost at the end](http://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/picture-14.png "45,000 words down")](http://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/picture-14.png)\[/caption\]
