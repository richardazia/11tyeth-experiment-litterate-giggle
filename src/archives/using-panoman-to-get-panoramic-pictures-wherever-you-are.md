If you're looking for a software that makes creating panoramic shots easy with a phone such as the N95 then [Panoman](http://www.panoman.net/) is an interesting option. It's a software that you install on the phone and helps you take a series of pictures before stitching them together. It does this by showing you a band with up to twelve possible images. As you take the first image keep the camera steady and pan to the right until the red border is filled with the next image. It automaticaly takes the picture. Repeat those steps and then press stop. Once that's done the software stitches the images together.

Here is one example of what you can get with nothing more than the phone.
