It's Sunday morning and yesterday was another day of shooting and editing. As a result of that, the documentary has progressed a little more. One or two more segments have been added, graphics have been improved and the project as a whole looks good. There's still a lot of work to be done and I've been thinking of extra graphics and shots that could help make the documentary more interesting to watch. Another 7hrs before editing is over for today
