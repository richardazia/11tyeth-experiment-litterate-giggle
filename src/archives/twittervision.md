Twitter is a global short messaging system that allows people to post what they are doing 140 characters at a time. For the moment it is a relatively new phenomenon therefore it's not too hard to keep track of the conversations going on. They are also geo logged. As you're watching people's messages you can see China say that they're getting ready for the night ahead whilst in Europe people are going out to lunch. In the US people are complaining about having to wake up early in order to catch their planes, go for walks or in certain cases go to bed. It's amusing and it's reminiscent of ten years ago when I spent 13hrs in a chatroom at a time when spending ten minutes online was expensive. it's cyclical. One thing is popular, then is replaced by something else before becoming popular again. One difference this time is the technology used. Google maps show where in the world people are tweeting from whilst the twitter site simply shows what people have written. It's amusing to watch the world and what people are doing in it.
