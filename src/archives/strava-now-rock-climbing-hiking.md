Strava now has rock climbing, hiking and many more sports. Sports tracker, movescount and other applications already allowed you to do this but it is nice to see one more network provide us with this option. \[caption id="attachment\_3340" align="aligncenter" width="189"\][![Strava expanded the number of sports you can track](http://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Screen-Shot-2016-08-31-at-17.53.52-189x300.png)](http://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Screen-Shot-2016-08-31-at-17.53.52.png) Strava expanded the number of sports you can track\[/caption\] Up until now I had to make sure to go for a bike ride or three per week to keep people updated on what I did. During week days I am likely to go for bike rides. On two to three evenings per week I may go climbing and on the weekend I may go hiking or for a walk. As a result I can track the diversity of my activities. \[caption id="attachment\_3341" align="aligncenter" width="169"\][![Strava has updated the list of sports](http://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Screenshot_20160831-181744-169x300.png)](http://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Screenshot_20160831-181744.png) Strava has updated the list of sports\[/caption\] With rock climbing I would like them to add two or three more fields. I would like them to add an option to add the grade of the climb we did. This would need to use the European and the American systems. It would help us track our progress and even track how hard we worked if we're wearing a heart monitor as we climb. In effect it could provide us with a way of seeing who else is climbing and whether we match their skill level. In the long run this could contribute to new groups. I have created a group for [Swiss Via Ferrata](https://www.strava.com/clubs/221362)Â in anticipation of via ferrata practitioners joining the network and sharing their climbs. Until recently I would only track cycling and running. Now that walking, hiking and climbing have been added I can track a number of new sports. It should result in people using the app more frequently. Â It could be fun to see climbing and hiking heat maps. We will see how they adapt the input section to match the sports.
