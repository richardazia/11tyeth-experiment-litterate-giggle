As you're painfully aware by now there are hundreds of social networking websites but none of them have a communal database. If you're on orkut your data stays there, if you're on yahoo communities your data is there. All these social networking websites are very similar in what they ask of you but different in how they link you. [Loudmouthman](http://www.kyte.tv/channels/view.html?name=social_networking#uri,channels/9360/45160) got me thinking about how you could use a database like freebase to share this data between networks, sort of like openid but with more data. [Freebase](http://www.freebase.com/) is a database for volunteers, similar to a wiki but whereas the wiki is a collection of articles this is a database where you write the front end and implement it according to your needs. If you're interested in video production and television for example you could take the television section of that database and make it accessible within that site. If you encouraged your users to create their profiles within that communal database then details which are not so critical to your persona (whilst being careful not to make phishing to easy)Â  could be used so that you input your data only once. By having a communal database the migration from one social networking website to another would be far smoother, more transparent. You'd have the same user profile in a number of places and you would have more freedom to concentrate on what you feel is important. If one website goes down then that is not as critical since your presence is spread in a number of places therefore there is less opportunity to be in trouble should your main social website go down, as was the case with [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com) and [Skype](http://www.skype.com) within the past few weeks. RSS feeds are already helping to spread your presence across a number of websites and sites like Jaiku and tumblr help aggregate your daily output to a number of locations.Â  As a result of such practices. In effect you'd have built in redundancy. If one node goes down then five others can be used whilst waiting for your preferredÂ  social network to come back online. In summary since we are members of more than one community there is a demand for a communal database from which the sharing of certain types of data would promote the spread of online presence between more than one community at a time. By facilitating the process of setting up a number of communities there is less opportunity for us to be bogged down in content we are uninterested in. Communities, rather than forums could be far more specific to our needs. I would welcome your views on this topic.
