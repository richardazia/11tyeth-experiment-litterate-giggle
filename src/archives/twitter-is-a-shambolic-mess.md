Twitter is a shambolic mess, reminiscient of a 2008 version of how hotmail was back in 1998 when I stopped using it. How many of you remember hotmail pre microsoft. I do. It worked fine. Then it became popular and it become really slow. That's when I spread to have ten to twenty e-mail accounts to see which would be better. yahoo mail and the account that came with the domain won until gmail came along. Anyway twitter is a pile of rubbish but it's better than anything else at what it does (for the moment.). It's a shame we can't get a reliable equivalent with an increased level of reliability.

I lost 600. The failwhale is up constantly. Some of my favourite tweeters were unfollowed. Thank you twitter for being down at the only moments of the day when I could chat with friends.
