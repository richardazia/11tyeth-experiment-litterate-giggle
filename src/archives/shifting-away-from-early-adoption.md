There's no one in Europe using brightkite yet but I'm there and I see that no one is in the vicinity. That's because there's a huge amount of attention on what the US is doing and not much left on what Europe is doing. It's a simple website to tell people where you are at all times. Of course there are a few projects like that in various countries and whilst it's great for some people others feel uncomfortable. Personally I'm indifferent, since there's no one in the vicinity that I could take the time to meet via that method. Of course there are others What I'm looking for are European social platforms that would create a similar environment to the one I would find in London when I lived there.
