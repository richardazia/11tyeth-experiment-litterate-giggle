[Google Local Guides](https://www.google.com/local/guides/) and I are mutually beneficial. I love to go up to the mountains and document their beauty and Google Local Guides needs images and reviews. I have been sharing images with Google Services for several years but it Google Local Guides is relatively recent. When I was added to the program they had already included several of my contributions. \[caption id="attachment\_3053" align="aligncenter" width="660"\][![One Hundred Thousand views](http://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Screen-Shot-2016-07-05-at-08.42.48-1024x623.png)](http://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Screen-Shot-2016-07-05-at-08.42.48.png) One Hundred Thousand views\[/caption\] The images that you see below are from Via Ferrata and hikes in Switzerland. They show the Leman, the Alps, the Jura and other peaks and valleys. In Summer I am among them every single weekend. Recently I have started to document these trips as 360 photographs which I then share with this service. \[gallery columns="2" size="medium" ids="3054,3055"\] My goal is to contribute at least 140 more images because I want to get a terabyte of storage for my pictures, to use as an online backup. As I use an android phone it logs the locations that I have been to and when I get home or to a computer I can review my location history and write a short review of the places as well as add images. This is an easy and intuitive process. The perks that I am currently entitled to are: _Get noticed with your Local Guides badge in Google Maps. Connect with other Local Guides in our exclusive Google+ Community. Lead the conversation by moderating Local Guides community channels. Receive invites to Google-hosted events in select cities._ For now the community travels internationally but it is principally United StatesÂ cities that are active with Barcelona, Edinburgh, London, Madrid, Paris and Sydney providing the international side of things. Some would say that Local Guides will challenge other services offering the same features but as Local Guides offer one terabyte of storage for images I am motivated to contribute a further 140 photographs and reviews as the opportunities come up.
