I spent a few minutes taking portraits of cows during my afternoon walk today. Cows were standing by the barrier so it was easy to go up to each one and take their portraits. It's not as if our vibrant social lives enable us to take portraits of people when we're self-isolating. It's day 39.

Mobile First Website
--------------------

This morning for three hours or so I continued working on making webpages mobile first and resubmitted them for indexing by Google. In the process I thought about how I have images that I could use to illustrate some of the points about geography, rock formations and other topics.

In the process I realised that some pages have been online for their fourth decade now. They were uploaded in the 90s, the navigation style was changed in the 2000s, they were dormant in the tens, and now in the 20s they're mobile compliant. A side effect of this is that they now have a page load score of 100.

On every walk I go on I see plenty of insects. I see plenty of bees too. They love the colza and other plants so it's a good place to go if you want to get photographs of inset life. I saw that Galaxus, a swiss online shop even offers wildbiene wall insect hotels.

I feel I should write more to make this blog post worthwhile. As I spend less time on Facebook and Twitter I find myself doing more diverse things in front of the computer and phone. I found that TikTok has some passable content.

I like watching these videos. They serve no purpose other than to pass the time, It took a pandemic for me to finally play with TikTok. For now I'm just lurking and watching videos but they're a little moment of nostalgia for pre-Corona life.

Some of these videos are a way of dreaming of what we could do soon. Look at this video crossing one of the longer suspension bridges.

Living in Switzerland is special. Imagine having this view every single day. In summer that's possible as there are fewer clouds, especially with more frequent droughts.

No one has said whether this is genuine. I don't know if they used these alarms as a Corona warning.

There is a very high likelihood of seeing something like this as this music plays in Switzerland. I've had such experiences so frequently.
