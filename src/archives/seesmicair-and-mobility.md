Last night at Four AM I got an alpha release of [SeesmicAIR](http://seesmicair.com/) from [Critter](http://twitter.com/critter) and I started to play with it. My initial response was good. It's fast, intuitive and it doesn't a browser. Today as I had lunch I went mobile with my laptop, relying on battery. Those who follow my blog know that I'm using a macbook pro and those that follow [my tweets](http://twitter.com/warzabidul) know that I was happy about something. Usually when i [seesmic](http://www.seesmic.com) I go into the user interface and I get told that my battery will last about an hour and a half to an hour as I seesmic. Today though I had almost three hours of battery life whilst being able to keep an eye on [seesmic](http://www.seesmic.com). That's because [SeesmicAIR](http://www.seesmicair.com) is running off Adobe and rather than use most of the CPU to work it's running with far fewer resources. As a result I can lurk on seesmic without killing the battery or running a hot machine. I saw that both Loic Lemeur and Johann are on the Eurostar and I was able to comment on seesmic and keep an eye on reactions. [Vinvin](http://twitter.com/vinvinoriginal) answered my question and it's good. I love the fact that I don't need to worry about battery life anymore. I've had time to prepare lunch, have lunch and then still have an hour and a half of battery life to write this post. I really enjoy having the ability to do this. It means that I can do something in the background. In brief SeesmicAIR is just as useful as I thought it would be.Â  It's still a little buggy but that's normal when dealing with Alpha.
