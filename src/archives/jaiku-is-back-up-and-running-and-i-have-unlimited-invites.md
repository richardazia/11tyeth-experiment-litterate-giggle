[Jaiku](http://www.jaiku.com) is up and running once more, from the google servers and it's faster. It's also lost no features. In fact it's gained one thing which will make some you happy. All those who already have unlimited invites so if you're interested in trying Jaiku from it's servers, send me a message by e-mail or a DM with your e-mail address and I'll send you the invite. In fact just leave a comment and I'll see your e-mail address that way. Don't leave it in the comment box itself though. It only took six days, that's like a leap year in normal people days.
