I completed the Apple May Activity Challenge yesterday. The goal was to walk or run 349 kilometres within one month. I finished this challenge two days early.

Using the [Apple Watch Series 3](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07K387Y7K/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B07K387Y7K&linkCode=as2&tag=richardazia-20&linkId=5ef318311ab8ff78597cad724c2f17bd)![](//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=richardazia-20&l=am2&o=1&a=B07K387Y7K) and the [SUUNTO Spartan Sport Wrist HR BARO](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B075T96HP8/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B075T96HP8&linkCode=as2&tag=richardazia-20&linkId=b1f78b3375d229fc26a1d25a8852f2d6) I tracked all of my activities. For the first two or three weeks I tracked activities with both devices and then deleted the duplicates on [Strava](https://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wordpress-and-strava/) and then I stopped tracking with the Apple Watch as I saw that activity data could be communicated to Apple's Activity tracking. ![](//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=richardazia-20&l=am2&o=1&a=B075T96HP8)

During the past month I walked 10-15 kilometres a day and when I didn't walk such distances I was cycling. As a result I have had a sporty month. I've walked in the rain, the wind, and recently the heat. I took up running again and this provides me with an opportunity to play with a podcast, and to play with apps.

Running requires for my legs to adapt to the sport so I'm doing shorter distances than my cardiovascular system can cope with. I don't want to feel knee pain so I'm doing less than I know I could. It's about building up gradually, and eventually exceeding my previous best.

Now I have two days to recover, before the next challenge.
