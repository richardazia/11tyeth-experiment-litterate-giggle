ooohhh I like this idea! Sounds good. Its time we got some more interesting metrics for twitter and move away from the ol' 'how many followers have you got' mindset. Maybe it could delve deeper into twitter conversations by looking at replies and RTs as well.

What makes this idea interesting is that those that attract twitter users get a higher rating :-). Scoble would still do well in this model. Others would do better.  
  
There are a few tweeks I think should be added once the app is working.
