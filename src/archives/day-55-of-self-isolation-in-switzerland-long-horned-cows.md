Long-Horned cows are a rare treat. We usually see short-horned or even de-horned cows in Switzerland. To see longhorn cow is a treat. I took a tiny detour from my walk to get some pictures. I have walked by the field a few times before seeing them close enough to the fence to consider taking pictures again.

One of them started to approach the fence so I moved back. I later noticed that some calves are in this field too.

We are now two days away from the 11th of May when shops will re-open and life gets one step closer to being "normal" again. We are going to be in a dangerous phase of the pandemic for two reasons. The first reason is that people aren't going to be as careful about who they come in contact with so the virus will have a new opportunity to spread within small communities.

The second reason is that I see people driving two or more hours to do activities in the mountains rather than staying locally. By combining the two the virus may grab the opportunity to start spreading again.

I am not critical of the government. I am critical of the people who are taking liberties that don't yet make sense. In theory I could be climbing Monday afternoon but I won't, because I think it would be wise to wait to to three weeks before enjoying such luxuries.

The best sport that we can do for the environment, and for each other's safety is cycling, whether on mountain bikes like these two people. or on road bikes like others. By cycling we are staying within a three hour radius of home, where our range is limited by our physical health.

It makes sense to continue enjoying what the local area has to offer. By now we should have seen that there are plenty of things to do locally. This is especially true for people who have experienced the pandemic in Switzerland.

Did you find some interesting walks by staying local?
