The title of this post is a joke, not a serious delusion of isolation. I saw that a few sunflowers had come out but that they were looking away, rather than towards me. They are looking at the morning sun and I was walking in the afternoon. They are still in the process of coming out.

Today I was asked if I wanted to go to a restaurant and I automatically said no. Given the data about the rising number of cases in Switzerland it makes no sense to go to towns or cities, and to eat in a crowded place, rather than to continue self-isolating. If I was okay with crowds at this stage in the pandemic I would have gone to the IFSC World cup. I am not fine with crowds, when the number of sick is rising.

One issue is that there seems to be no data for the Canton de Vaud for the last week or two. I don't know whether that means that there are no cases, or that they have not been counted. Haute Savoie and Geneva are going up, so Vaud should follow.

Every Canton is deep red except for Neuchatel, for now.

The table above illustrates why it makes sense not to meet people in towns, cities, restaurants or other places. There is a chance that you could continue as normal, and be fine, but if enough people think that way then large crowds form, and what was safe, in small numbers, becomes a breeding ground for large numbers. At this point, it's better to walk in the countryside and be ignored by sunflowers.

If I had been asked "Do you want to come over" then I would have said yes, without hesitation. I said no because in my opinion, and according to the data I see, it is not safe to risk spending time around crowds, for now.

Imagine going back to such habits

When the pandemic ends I look forward to meeting new people to do new things, but for now the likelihood of this happening is low. Yesterday's solo bike ride was good. I avoided the roads where traffic is aggressive as much as possible, and kept to the more rural, quieter paths. The weather was perfect yesterday.

Today, during the entire walk I felt that it would rain at any minute, but it didn't. It stayed dry, and that's good because I was not equipped for the rain.
