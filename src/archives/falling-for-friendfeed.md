[Friendfeed](http://friendfeed.com/warzabidul) is an interesting service I never wanted to use because I prefered Jaiku but recently that feeling has changed. As I saw Scoble speak more and more about how good friendfeed was I began to think that maybe it's time to try the service, to see what it's about and to see how well it works. As a result of the past day using the service I begin to enjoy i. What I like about this service is that it's an aggregation of all the content that friends are creating. it's not content produced by IRL friends but rather by interesting people from various corners of the web. We see their images, their posts and the articles they find interesting, as well as comments detailing why they are of value. A change I've noticed, at least today, is that as I watch the live feed I find myself reading more posts, following the conversation and being quite a bit more receptive than I would be to links on twitter. That's possibly because the site is still new to me but it may also be because it's a nice mixture, more visual than other solutions. As a result of this first day of using it properly there's a good chance I will continue experimenting with the site, seeing what I can gain from it in the long run.
