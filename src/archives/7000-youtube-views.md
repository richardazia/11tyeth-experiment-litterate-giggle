Over the past month I have seen an increase of 7000 views in relation to the videos I have posted on youtube. The two events that helped make this a reality are the Geneva Lake Parade and the Paleo Festival. For the Paleo Festival scantily clad girls were an attractive proposition. As to the paleo it was taking video I had streamed live on qik and sharing it via a number of video sharing websites of which youtube was one. To give an idea of the audience peaks we saw over 900 views for the Lake Parade footage and over 1300 views for Manu Chao. That's a respectable audience. The question is whether there are any events you would like me to cover (via live streaming from a mobile phone) and whether that would attract a big enough audience.
