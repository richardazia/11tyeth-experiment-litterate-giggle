[VIA FERRATA](https://vimeo.com/126415912) from [Summitride](https://vimeo.com/summitride) on [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com). Of course riding a mountain bike down a via ferrata is impossible. What is possible is riding the bike at the start and end of a via ferrata. In this video we see an individual ride down some routes where we would not feel at ease with full safety gear.
