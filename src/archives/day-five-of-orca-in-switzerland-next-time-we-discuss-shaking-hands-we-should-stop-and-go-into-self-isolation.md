It's Day Five of ORCA in Switzerland. Next time we discuss shaking hands we should stop, and go into self-isolation. We had all the signs that a pandemic was coming. We knew about China and we saw what was going on in Italy. We knew that a virus was infecting people at a rapid rate.

When I chose not to go to the Graduate Institute because I knew a Pandemic was coming I was right. It wasn't worth the risk. If everyone had had the common sense, and forethought to start isolating we wouldn't have seen such a rapid increase in the spread of the virus.

When I saw people discussing whether to shake hands I thought it was alarmist and stupid and to some degree, I wasn't wrong. I was wrong to think we should shake hands but I was right to start avoiding large groups. The trick, to avoid pandemics is to follow international news, and see what is happening in other countries, and to see what actions they are taking. we should then take the same actions pre-emptively.

If everyone outside of Italy had taken those actions sooner the virus would have struggled to spread and society might have fewer affected people.

The lesson we should have learned is that when we see a pandemic is coming we should discuss whether to go into self-isolation, rather than whether to shake hands.
