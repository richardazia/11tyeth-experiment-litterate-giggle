Commentary

[Amelie](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0000640VO/perspectives)

Amelie as it is called in England but "Le Fabuleux Destin D'amelie Poulain is the story of a fairly ordinary girl whom through finding a box full of objects decides to return it to it's owner. When she sees the effect it has on the owner she decides to begin start helping others. The film is beautifully shot, the editing is very interesting and there are many amusing moments. Having watched the film at least five times I would recommend this as a film to see.  [My essay on Amelie Poulain](https://main-vision.com/richard/amelie_poulain.htm)
