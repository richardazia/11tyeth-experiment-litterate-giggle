Dear Richard, How are you? My name is Priya, and I came across your blog while looking up blogs about Ingress. I am pursuing my Masters in Tourism. For my dissertation, I want to research on how Location Based Games (specifically Ingress) influences tourism at a destination. Even though you mentioned last February, that you are no longer playing Ingress, I was wondering if you could spare me some time to talk about your experience in general. Please consider this as a sincere request for your valuable time for an interview. I will appreciate it very much. Looking forward to your response. Kind Regards, Priya
