We're having dry weather which means that I have clean shoes, once again. They cut the grass recently but rather than see greenery we see yellow. We're in March and it already looks as if we're un June/July, with how dry the landscape is. The sides of the road, where it was once muddy, is now dry and hard. We are in summer dry weather despite being the first of march.

It's windy and cold at the moment. You want to wear a good hat, good gloves, and to have layers that stop the wind from blowing through to chill us.

It was cold enough to kill the airpods after an hour of exposure to the weather today. On a warm day the airpods last for two or three hours. On a cold day they last for half an hour to an hour. With walks that last from one hour to one and a half hours I usually never run out of batteries. It's a sign of cold weather that the batteries last less time than the walk.

In other news twitter failed again today for at least an hour or two. With mobile devices I tried to refresh the feed but saw nothing. I could still post and see replies, but I couldn't read new tweets. Now that we expect Twitter to fail on a regular basis we don't feel the same angst as before. It is unimportant.

And Finally - Mud season
------------------------

At least [one Londoner loves the mud](https://www.backpacker.com/skills/mud-hiking-season-is-almost-here-heres-how-to-embrace-it/?utm_source=pocket_saves) because it absorbs his steps and lowers the pain he felt when walking on tarmac and other hard surfaces. I am puzzled by one recommendation. "Have a towel ready". I know that football players have a brush and running water to clean their shoes. The idea of using a towel is new to me. I can think about it, next time it rains, in a few months from now.
