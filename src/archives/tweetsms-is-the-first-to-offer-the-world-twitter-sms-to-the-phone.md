If everything goes according to plan [tweetsms](http://www.tweetsms.com/) will be the first to offer the world the opportunity to receive sms from twitter to their phones. They [released the prices today](http://www.tweetsms.com/about/pricing) and by Friday we should be able to use the service once the bugs are worked out. Looking forward to that moment
