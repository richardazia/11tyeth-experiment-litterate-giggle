Playing with technology is a great way of learning new skills but occasionaly you are let down by it. This happened to me tonight when I wanted to do episode four of twittervox. The entire day I had an excellent connection and things were downloading at a good speed. Wait until it's time for twitter vox and the connection crashed down to just 500 bytes per second up and 1.5 kilobytes per second up. That's hardly enough to do text chat. There are two reasons why this problem may occur. The first of these is that someone is downloading torrents and this is eating up all the bandwidth. The second option is that because this home is using a cable rather than adsl connection the speed ebbs and flows according to how many people are using the connection. Tomorrow at some point during the day I will record some answers to the various points in such a manner that I will have participated even if it's with a lag of several hours. If I can't use the technology when I want then there is so much redundancy that I will use other methods.
