[![](http://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/20110327-115137-200x300.jpg "Feedly screengrab 1")](http://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/20110327-115137.jpg)Feedly is an application that takes google reader's feeds and displays them in a more appealing manner. The browsing experience is more enjoyable as a result. The first item is displays on a splash page as ou see on the left. Flick to the right and you get a list of articles. This list fits articles to fill the screen. You must flick to the right to get to the next article. Click on the article and the text goes full screen. You can Â then bookmark articles, like them or share. Sharing is the standard tweet, mail, copy url, open in browser and mobilize. [![Feedly navigation](http://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/20110327-115128-200x300.jpg "navigation.jpg")](http://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/20110327-115128.jpg) Feedly navigation is done via the bottom left corner of the screen as you see in the image to the right. Click on this and you get a list of feeds you haveÂ subscribedÂ to. This is the google reader list. Reading of feeds can be either by individual rss feed or by category. The number of unread posts is visible to the right. Active feeds can be read individually.   [![Automatic feed creation](http://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/20110327-121811-200x300.jpg "automatic.jpg")](http://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/20110327-121811.jpg)One of the most interesting features of feedly is it's ability to auto-generate smart lists of interesting blog posts according to popularity/buzz, whether they were saved for later, essentials, latest and more. Buzz allows you to see which of the posts are most interesting according to popularity within the RSS feeds you and your contacts are subscribed to. There is no ability to comment on articles at this moment in time and integration into google buzz is not possible yet. As a result you can quickly skim through articles but should you want to offer an opinion you will have to resort to another app. Everything that Feedly offered to it's users on computers and laptops is now available to it's users via the mobile application. As a result your user experience will be the same across both platforms. With the iPhone version of this product you can read all articles while on the move, on trains in cars, or when waiting for a queue to move forward.
