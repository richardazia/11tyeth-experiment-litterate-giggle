[Undeveloped World War II Film Discovered](http://vimeo.com/116735360) from [The Rescued Film Project](http://vimeo.com/rescuedfilmproject) on [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com).

We all have a deep fascination for the past and photography gives us a window in to that past. This documentary follows one individual as he catalogues and then develops 31 rolls of film. As he does so images and moments that have not been remembered for decades are finally visible for a modern audience. These images contribute to what Dziga Vertov called the All Seeing Eye. He wanted to document life unawares.
