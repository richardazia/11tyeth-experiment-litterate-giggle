In normal times a [forest fire in the Chernobyl exlusion zone](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/06/bad-news-radiation-spikes-16-times-above-normal-after-forest-fire-near-chernobyl) would attract attention and environmentalists would actively speak about it. The world would pay attention. Due to the pandemic the news story is low on the agenda.

I mentioned that a coffee shop and a pet shop had reopened on Monday and this morning I read that [markets would be allowed to take place](https://www.lfm.ch/actualite/vaud/lausanne/les-marches-de-lausanne-rouvrent-partiellement/). Instead of the usual 160 stands, there would be just 30. In articles When reading other articles I saw that there was a mention that in order to be more confident that the virus was slowing down there would have to be zero transmissions for 14 days or more. We are still far from that today.

A gradual decrease in the number of COVID-19 cases in Switzerland

I'd rather sacrifice for two or three weeks now and preserve summer, than be too hasty, and lose the advantage we seem to have at the moment.

Click the image to read that story from Radio lac. According to Dider Pittet, speaking on RTSInfo we would need [two and a half million masks per day](https://www.rts.ch/info/suisse/11229598-il-faudrait-2-5-millions-de-masques-par-jour-pour-deconfiner-les-suisses.html) to protect people in Switzerland alone. On a global scale many more masks would be needed.

#### Phone Addiction

Of course during this period when people are stuck at home, unable to socialise in person they are meant to turn towards the phone and use messaging and social media apps to share news with friends and family. Some people use this as an opportunity to say that people are all the more addicted to their phones than before.

I find the opposite is true. Yesterday I forgot my phone at home when I went for a walk and I could easily have gone back upstairs to get it but I didn't because A) I didn't need it and B) my walk was going to be short.

I should go for a walk now but I can't really be bothered. I don't want to avoid people. I don't want to overcome my fear of dogs. I would love for this pandemic, so that I could try something different. I'd like to go for a bike ride but if I do that I need to be careful not to stray too far and I still need to avoid people.

The main reason for going out is to get some sunshine.

For exercise I have Zwift.

if you need a reason to stay indoors and to self-isolate watch the video below.
