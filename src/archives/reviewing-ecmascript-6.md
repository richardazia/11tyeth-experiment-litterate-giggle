Recently I have spent time focusing on JavaScript [and EcmaScript](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-ecmascript-6-plus-es6-plus/) to make sure that I understand it. By now it is over a year ago since I felt that I wanted to study Angular but felt that I didn't have enough knowledge to resolve the challenges so I decided to return to basics. My return to basics involved a number of courses and books but it also led me to study this [Linkedin Learning Pathway](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/paths/advance-your-skills-in-javascript). It is easy to study, get a certiciate and move on, especially for extroverts or outgoing people who find interacting with people easy.

If I know people then I do find it easy. In other scenarios I struggle. I am working to ensure that if and when I say that I have certain skills, that I have those skills. I want to understand what I am doing and why.

A while ago I managed to get my instagram feed from Instagram JSON files to Wordpress via a number of steps and this felt good but I felt that I did not fully understand what I had done. Since then I have studied JSON, JS and other related technologies so I should be able to accomplish the same task more easily, and with fewer tools. I have to decide whether I want to import this data into wordpress or whether I want to run it outside of the CMS.

Such a project will encourage me to conceptualise and then realise my goal, without the skeleton of a course behind it to provide me with guidance. I want this to be a self driven project. It will indicate my progress. When I decide to take the plunge I should find the task easy.

I always find new things to learn, during this pandemic, and these new things keep me occupied and distracted from the eternal return that are these days.
