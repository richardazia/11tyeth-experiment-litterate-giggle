[BRAGI - The Dash -- Wireless Smart In Ear Headphones](https://vimeo.com/86462683) from [BRAGI](https://vimeo.com/user24665825) on [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com). I enjoy cycling, running, climbing and via Ferrata so this type of device is well suited to my needs. The price is not. At 300 USD it is an iPod shuffle replacement at its core. From what I understand [The Dash](http://www.bragi.com/) can track steps, heart rate and duration of sports so in theory you can go without a sports watch, sports tracker or mobile phone. In practice, I never leave the house without my phone. I do see it filling a swimming niche. Most mobile phones are not IP68 certified. If this device is IP 68 certified (I could not find information on the website) then I see it being especially interesting for swimmers. According to their website they can be used for four hours in between charges but charge time is two hours. They will last through most workouts. The limitations I see to this device are first and foremost the price. I don't want to pay 300 USD for something that I am likely to lose. I listen to podcasts and audio books and like to have several on my devices at all times. Both my mobile phone and iPod classic fill these roles with ease. When the price for these devices descends to 200 USD I will be willing to buy a set. I would also like to have either two sets of earphones or a charge time of just an hour rather than two.Â They say that the app is coming soon. As an audiobook and podcast listener, I want to save my progress and bookmark interesting passages. I would like to see this incorporated to the gestures that control the device.
