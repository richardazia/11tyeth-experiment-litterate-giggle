[Seesmic'](http://www.seesmic.com) favourite phone at the moment appears to be the Nokia N95 and after months of thinking about whether to get the Iphone or the Nokia I turned to the Nokia because of everything it allows you to do. It's a GPS, web streaming camera, time lapse camera, e-mail and web browser among other things. It's also easy to use with services like Jaiku. **Streaming** Video stremaing from computers is becoming commonplace and as a result we're growing tired of that piece to camera straight from people's desk. That's where [Bambuser](http://alpha.bambuser.com/channel/warzabidul), [Qik](http://qik.com/warzabidul) and [seesmic](http://www.seesmic.com) come into play. [Bambuser](http://alpha.bambuser.com) is still in alpha and has an intuitive easy to use streaming interface giving you an easy selection between the main camera and the front camera. It's very simple to use and I've played quite a bit with it but there are lag issues where the stream doesn't keep up. The settings can be adjusted quite specifically by the user allowing for quite a bit of experimentation. A second service is [Qik](http://www.qik.com). This one has a nice user interface and has in built buffering. This means that as you stream the application buffers and indicates the delay between what you are seeing on the phone and what is being seen. This service has too main options. Optimised for quality or optimised for creating a reliable stream. [Seesmic](http://www.seesmic.com) has already been discussed but it's a good video sharing website. It allows for conversations to take via video similarly to instant messaging. The Seesmic application still needs some work but if you're using shozu you can record your seesmic posts and FTP the files to the site for others to enjoy. I've done a few posts from the car once I've arrived at work and the results are good, except for a loss of synchronisation... but that's in camera rather than seesmic. [Â **Jaiku**](http://www.jaiku.com) Jaiku was developed by people who worked for Nokia and it's similar to twitter but with a better front end mobile wise. The application automatically displays where you are, whether you're free or busy to answer calls and you can follow conversations. **Photo CameraÂ ** One interestig feature of the camera that I haven't used is the ability to take a picture every ten seconds. In other words to create time lapses that last as long as you would like. I haven't tried the option but the idea is interesting. **GPSÂ ** I haven't played with the GPS so far but so far it looks nice enough, I'll write more once I know more. So far I'm happy with the N95 because of all it can do and I'm looking forward to using it extensively in the near future. As I learn more about the phone and what it can do I'll write most posts.
