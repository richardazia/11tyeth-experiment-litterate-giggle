It would seem that this will be the summer of barbecues because of the amount of meat leftover from last night. With a friend, we went over to France and bought four kilos of meat, a nice little quantity. Too much for two friends to eat in one sitting but that's what happened last night. Out of curiosity I wanted to see whether a Facebook invite to a barbecue would be enough, in Switzerland to have a party and it appears it wasn't. As a result of this, I have a kilo of sausages and a kilo of chicken leftover to enjoy but there's no way I'm going to get through that in one sitting so I'm going to have a series of barbecues over the next two or three days.
