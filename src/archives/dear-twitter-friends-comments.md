I thought it was a joke at first as well, but I did see this coming.  
  
Sounds like you've been pretty frustrated with Twitter lately. I followed your secondary account, but won't be offended if you don't follow back ;)  
  
Best wishes,  
Mark

It's no joke, I did delete that account. I have a backup of my last 3800 tweets on that account and thousands more are backed up on various portions of the web, either through tweetbackup, greader or others.  
  
One of the reasons for my frustration has been how people speak and profess their knowledge of social networks yet are to conventional to actually use them to their full potential.  
  
As a result I am still on twitter, but with a far reduced presence.

:( My nights aren't the same without your tweets. I understand your thoughts completely though. How many of your followers ever bothered to subscribe to this feed? \[raises hand\]  
  
I thought I was better at using the social nets to their full potential, but Twitter and other places have exposed me to so many of them, that I use a lot, but none to full potential, something I will try to address in the coming weeks and months.  
  
I'll be trying to keep up with you elsewhere now, keep us updated on the Twitterless life. :)

I still tweet but just warza, rather than warzabidul as a twitter name and I am still following you from that account. Those who were following me, in large part were friends. Too many of them took too long to aknowledge my tweets so they were devalued.  
  
Now it's a new twitter account and friendfeed. On friendfeed I'm one of the two hundred most active users of the site at the moment.  
  
Follow my new twitter account.

Thought it was a joke but you really did it!  
Impressive somehow...

I was on twitter for two years with an average tweet rate of 72.6 per day. And from one day to the next it no longer exists. Too many superficial people on the site. It was time for me to move on. I am using a secondary account but twitter is going to be a far smaller part of my life. So small that I will only go to check on twitter when I have replies or a new follow.  
  
It's like that relationship you see going nowhere. It was time to break up. I made sure there was no going back and I'm happy for that.
