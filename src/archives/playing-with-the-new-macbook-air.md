As I write this I'm playing with the new macbook air and already i-ve twittered and seesmiced from it. The keyboard is fine and the user interface is good. The only idiotic thing is the mouse button is far too small. I don-t see the point of such a thin slither of a mouse.Â Â Now how many people are envious of me testing a macbook air?Â Now to test the multicontrols :-)Â update: Can't test the multicontrols. Haven't put any pics on so can't test that feature. What a shame.Â update 2: The multifinger image manipulation is really fun. Everyone should try it. Turn it. Flip it. zoom in, edit, move over a little, more manipulation. I like it. Wait for the tech on some of the higher spec machines though. It's got some nice technology.Â
