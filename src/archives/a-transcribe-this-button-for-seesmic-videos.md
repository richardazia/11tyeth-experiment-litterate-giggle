Something I would love to see on Seesmic, and which would encourage me to use it more is a "transcribe this" button for when I record certain videos. The logic is simple. Sometimes we discuss things that we would like to see discussed but not everyone wants to listen to us explain our idea. That's why it would be a nice feature. As an add on you could then add that video to your blog, with a transcript for quick and practical reference.
