Dan: I will do, decided to start a new blog at the same time, in parallel with this one. I'll keep an eye on your blog by the same opportunity. Dean: It was nice to meet you outside of England for a change, away from the usual anglo saxon environment. I did create a secondary twitter account but for the moment I don't use that one much although I may need to push it back into service for those that don't like me to saturate them too greatly. I'll let you know when it's up and running once more.

Hey, of course the pleasure was mutual. We should continue but I'll have to pay more attention to your blog so I can react more often :-)

Richard, it was great meeting you as well... I was honestly blown away with the amount of passion and progression Europeans have in the social media space - very cool. Be sure to keep in touch. http://www.twitter.com/danmartell
