You should always visit friends in their country of origin because it's fun. Within a week I'll be in Sweden enjoying Swedish hospitality. I booked the flights today so within a few days I'll be flying off once more. It's not that being in a country for too long bothers me but simply that this opportunity won't last very long. I liked Sweden the previous two times I've been there so I'm going again. It's a bit of a misnomer because although I'm a full-time student I only have 2hrs a week of tuition with the rest of the time left for dissertation work, work experiences, and of course the technology module. I've been listening to this week in media, power user tv, Net at Night, and This week in tech for several months by now, therefore, it's part of my culture to think about tech.
