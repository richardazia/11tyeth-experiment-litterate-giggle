Nice View of the Alps from the Tour D'AÃ¯
-----------------------------------------

Tour D'aï via ferrata is a nice option if you are looking for aÂ view of the Alps and of the Lac LÃ©man region. You can take the telecabine from Leysin to the top and from here walk one hour and get to the base of the Via Ferrata de La Tour D'AÃ¯. This is a challenging via ferrata if you are not accustomed to heights. What makes the views so enjoyable is also what makes the via ferrata itself so daunting.

Best feature
------------

The best aspect of the Tour D'AÃ¯Â via ferrata is the chimney where you go up at the entrance to a crack. There are hand holds on two rock faces and you can use just one side like I did yesterday or use both sides like I did on past climbs. It depends on yourÂ fitness level, comfort and size. This via ferrata does have one or two overhangs which need to be negotiated. As the clipping and unclipping of carabiners occurs both before and after the overhanging bits they are easy to negotiate. Once you are at the top of the mountain you can look at the views and have a snack before walking down. \[gallery ids="2334,2335,2336,2337,2338,2339,2340,2341,2342,2347"\]

Walking Down.
-------------

The first part of the walk down requires sure footedness as the path is narrow. You can hold on to a cable for some of the more exposed portions and then walk down one ladder and later scramble down some rocks. After that you follow the road and foot path down the mountain. When you arrive to the foot of the village you have the option of continuing down or turning left and walking up to Plan Praz. Be advised that Plan Praz is a physical VF where arm and hand strength are necessary.
