It's the final day of production today, we have three acts to film and two links as well. We'll have someone going through a guillotine and another act of which I am not sure yet. it should start from 0900 until 1700 this evening. Yesterday was fine but it felt that a lot of time was wasted for a variety of reasons, leaving me a little dissatisfied.
