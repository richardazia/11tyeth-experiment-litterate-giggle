The [Tricaster](http://www.newtek-europe.com/uk/index.asp) is a Multimedia portable switcher. In other words it's an OB van in a box. It's a vision mixing deck on the light. They range from having two sources to six depending on your needs. Rather than have racks and racks of expensive gear to lug around for low budget shoots you get this gadget, plug in a few external sources and get your laptop plugged in. You can mix between a number of sources, do chroma key, play videotapes and even record onto internal drives. It's not a bad alternative to think about when working on smaller scale multicamera productions
