Now that I am seventy kilometres from finishing the Camino De Santiago virtually I have less than a week of virtual walking left. I walk in the real world, but the distance is mapped onto a virtual Camino. This is advantageous for two reasons. The first is that it makes walking around in circles near home less boring, but also because it means that there is less one less individual on the Camino De Santiago, so one less person contributing to population stress. I am doing this via the Pacer app.

According to their schedule I have 111 days in which to complete the walk, so I will complete it with over one hundred days to spare. I wasn't even walking that much compared to this summer. Their target for walking 800 kilometres was too long for me. My habits are faster. At the same time I do not walk 30-40 kilometre days like thru-hikers do.

For years and years I have had points via a card, and for years I have never used them because I never had anything that tempted me. I saw someone that had a Sigg bottle I was not familiar with so I looked at it, and then I was told that I could get it with those points. Of course being the individual that I am, what I am looking for is something that can replace my Camelbak forge.

CamelBak Forge
--------------

For years I loved using the Camelbak forge, until, eventually I overtightened it too many times, and so the top became loose, and dangerous. Imagine freshly boiled water, carried via the cap rather than the base, and you have a painful accident waiting to happen.

Sigg Travel Mug
---------------

As I browsed through a variety of options I found the Sigg [Travel Mug](https://sigg.com/ch-en/travel-mug-miracle-black-0-47l/). It comes in 0.27L and 0.47L versions and I chose the larger version. The difference is 5 CHF. When I worked 4am shifts one winter I really liked having such a drinking vessel. I then used it constantly for long enough for it to fail on me.

It is nice to have hot drinks on demand when you're fighting to stay awake, and when you're outdoors working in cold weather. It is also nice when sitting at a desk.

Environmental Reasoning
-----------------------

The kettle I have requires me to boil at least 800ml of water at a time, but if I prepare just one cup then I waste a lot of energy and water. My solution, for a while, has been to boil that volume of water, but to pour it into a thermos, that way the drinks stay warm, and I can drink the hot drink hours later, or even the next morning.

Horizon/Neso Niche
------------------

If you're sitting at a desk, or at home, unscrewing a top is not an issue, but when you're driving anything that allows you to remain focused on the road is good, and that is where the Camelbak forge and travel mug are good. The Camelbak Horizon and Sigg Travel Mug Pure ceram could also be considered except for one serious flaw. They need to be upright to keep your drink from leaking. Although named Horizon the Camelbak Horizon prefers to be vertical. If you shake or lean it then it leaks. If you have a car with cup holders then this isn't an issue. I don't, so I anticipate a mess.

Purchase justification
----------------------

The Forge failed months ago and I was looking for a replacement. I finally see that I can replace it for 15 CHF so I am seizing that opportunity.
