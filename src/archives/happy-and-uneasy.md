Nouvo is a show I have enjoyed watching many times, aired on Swiss television and in podcast form until recently. They are changing format and appearing on the website and news programs from now on. What makes this particularly interesting is that they left a comment on this blog, asking to interview the person behind Warzabidul, my twitter name for the past two years. I accepted and after two half hour phone calls we spent half a day. I was filmed at home tweeting at breakfast, walking through the countryside and in the old town of Geneva. Two other people were interviewed about twitter as well, to provide some balance. That news item will be aired on Sunday 19th of April on the [1930 TÃ©lÃ©journal](http://www.tsr.ch/tsr/index.html?siteSect=200000&wysistatpr=tsrinfo.ch), as well as on the [Nouvo site](http://www.nouvo.ch/home). They also have a new [twitter account](http://twitter.com/nouvo) so once you've watched the two accounts make sure to create an account and let them know you've watched the program. Let's show that Switzerland too uses the social media. As an afterthought you should see the seesmic logo on my laptop, maybe seesmic desktop, nambu, dabr, twitterific and maybe one or two other applications.
