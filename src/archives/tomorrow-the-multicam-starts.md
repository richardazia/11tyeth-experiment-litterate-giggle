Today's been a long day, beginning at 9 with lectures and finishing at 1800 with tape logging and transcribing. It passed through some studio work, laying the floor, and such. Tomorrow we start at 9am and continue till night in order to get all our shots finished with. We'll get a lunch break so have to factor that into any planning. I should have an early night but it's halls and there's alcohol around so others are drinking the night away and forgetting to adjust their volume control. Vivement Samedi
