Today for the second time we went to the Dive site in Duingt. It is located on the Lac D'Annecy a short drive from Annecy. The dive site is near a castle and the dive is down the flanc towards the cliff. The dive takes you by some submerged trees that would have fallen in to the lake at some point. The visibility is good and you can see the occasional fish and crayfish at this time of year. During this dive I was experimenting with the Gopro. When I gather more footage I will share it. \[flickr-gallery mode="photoset" photoset="72157632626270608"\]
