If you don't have much time to see what everyone is doing then twitter100 is a really interesting option. It allows you to see what up to 100 people you're following are doing at that moment in time. It allows you to see who you'd like to respond to. It's easy to use, all you need is your user name.

It displays better when not in full screen at full resolution. It's not something I'd use all the time
