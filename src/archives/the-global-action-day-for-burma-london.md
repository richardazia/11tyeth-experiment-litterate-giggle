Today was the Global Action day for Burma. The event was centered around a march from the Tate Britain, via the Houses of Parliament before arriving at Trafalgar Square at which point several speeches were made. You can recognise those who were part of the protest for the red ribbons they wore and the t-shirts. I met two friends who were taking photographs, [Danfung Dennis](http://www.danfungdennis.com/) and Crina Boros. Danfung has had quite a few interesting assignments. Crina was doing an MA whilst I was completing my final year of studies.
