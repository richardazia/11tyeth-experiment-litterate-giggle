It's easy to get ideas but it's harder to organise them and that's where mind mapping software like [Freemind](http://freemind.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page) comes in. It's an easy to use open source solution that allows to create and share mind maps. I originally came across it when experimenting with it's ipod touch and iphone counterpart, [Ibluesky](http://www.tenero.co.uk/products/). It's intuitive, allows for easy export for website integration, image and e-mail to desktops for further work.
