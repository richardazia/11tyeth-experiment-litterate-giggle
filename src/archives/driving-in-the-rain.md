Yesterday i drove through the rain for two hours at night and it was so demanding that i stopped the audiobook to focus on driving. It was harder to see the lines, and the rain was heavy enough to impact visibility.

I made it but i would think twice about driving through such rain at night on a 12hr drive for the last two hours.
