You can tell when someone joins a social network by what they think the network is for. I joined twitter in 2006. No one knew what the network was best at, eventually everyone decided to use it as a conversation tool. When people understood how dynamic conversations could be the network grew. The author of "[What if Twitter Died](http://recode.net/2016/02/04/what-if-twitter-died/)"wrote this: "it canâ€™t seem to stretch beyond its celebrity, celebrity follower and tech roots. If you arenâ€™t into celebrities or the tech industry, Twitter just isnâ€™t that appealing, especially given all the other options for online social interactions." It is clear from this writer's post that he has not been with twitter since it's earliest days. His twitter profile indicated that he arrived in 2010. That's up to two years after the golden age of twitter ended. My previous posts have explored this topic in depth. While social media focus on marketers and public relations professionals I will keep blogging.Â It allows me to express myself without providing content for platforms that have destroyed the social dimension.
