You build up plenty of dust as you plow the fields at the moment. The drought continues, as does the desire for this pandemic to be over. For now, the downward trend continues so we could feel optimistic. I'm still optimistic than in two or three weeks recycling centres will go back to normal. At the moment recycling centres remind me of something else.

Looking at this queue of cars reminds me of something. All the engines are off. All the cars are lined up. Plenty of people are in their cars waiting. If you saw this in Calais you'd expect them either to be waiting for the Eurotunnel train to get back to England or for the ferries to take them.

This is an image of Swiss people waiting to get into a recycling centre. Despite this being the 31st day of the pandemic Swiss peoples' desire and compulsion remains strong. For many people this is the lazy person's equivalent of "getting out of the house for a bit". I go for a one and a half hour walk and they sit in their cars, enjoying the fresh air, the tweets of the birds, and best of all a great view on the Mont Blanc. For the last two days we've had a good view.

Today I have spent very little time on Twitter and Facebook because I still can't stand either of them. I'm thinking of deleting both accounts when this pandemic is over. I spent time modernising my weebsite instead. Pages that haven't been changed since the late 90s are finally being updated and included within this CMS. The inspiration came as a result of seeing that Google told me in an e-mail that 21 pages were not AMP compatible.

in 1919 people made their own face masks as well. Getting a face mask on a cat does seem troublesome.

Last night I watched this during and after having dinner last night. I feel the need for watching people hike, and socialising. We're now on day 31. We're officially a month in. If we were in a different context then I would have almost completed [one Via Alpina route](https://www.schweizmobil.ch/en/hiking-in-switzerland/route-01.html) by walking several hundred kilometres.

When I started reading about Thur-Hiking it was in blog form, with pictures, and then books, and occassionaly podcasts and then, during this pandemic, I started watching videos of people's hiking adventures. It's a way of seeing nice landscapes and imagining what would be possible in Europe. It's good to plan for the future, and it's good to have plans that do not require much or any contact with others. Via Ferrata, climbing and other sports may not start again for a while after the last new transmission of the virus. Hiking, however should be possible.

I haven't watched this yet.

My project, for the next few days, is to continue shifting all my old website content to this blog. I should learn something new in the process.

I need to eat dinner now.
