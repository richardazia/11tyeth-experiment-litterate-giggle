The most striking thing about a winter with little to no snow is that there is no noise. Normally ski lifts clank, people talk and there is a lot of noise

When there has been very little snow the ski lifts are turned off and the mountains are quiet. This is when you realise the impact of winter sports.

In summer you hear cowbells.
