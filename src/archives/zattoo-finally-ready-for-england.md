Zattoo is a little bit of code that allows you to watch streaming television from the comfort of your laptop rather than using a television or other device.Â  It's better than Joost because they don't discriminate against PowerPC users. It means I can watch BBC 1, 2 3 4, ITV, C4 CBBC, BBC news 24 (that's the crappy England only version). I'm happy to see this change. I had tested it months ago in Switzerland and found the product interesting. You can read more [here.](http://zattoo.com/)
