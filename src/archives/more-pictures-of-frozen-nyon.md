Here are more pictures of frozen Nyon. These were taken with an Olympus rather than the iPhone. Notice the texture of the ice and the berries that have been captured within the ice. Beautiful setting. I wore quite a few layers. They kept me warm. \[flickr-gallery mode="photoset" photoset="72157629169768185"\]
