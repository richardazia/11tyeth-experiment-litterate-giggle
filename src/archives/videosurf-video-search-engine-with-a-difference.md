[Videosurf](http://www.videosurf.com/about), still in beta is an interesting way to search videos. I got my invite this morning and so far there are a number of features I find interesting but I'll learn more about it before going into detail. When it's ready it will be an interesting to site to use to sort through many videos at once and will allow you to see what's within the video, at least visually so far.
