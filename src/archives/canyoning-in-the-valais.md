Canyoning shows you some beautiful geographical locations but is nonetheless a dangerous sport. Make sure to practice jumping from lower heights before trying an eight meter jump. A via ferrata friend injured herself. It brought back flashbacks from another canyoning trip I never want to experience again. For that reason I am questioning whether I will go canyoning again. \[flickr-gallery mode="photoset" photoset="72157627484493352"\]
