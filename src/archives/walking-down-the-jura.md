View of La Dole and the limestone rock.

Today I woke up and instead of cycling up to see this view and have a meal I decided to do the opposite. I would walk down. Two or three summers ago I walked up and they took four or five hours. Walking down is much easier.

One or two bits are steep and my shoes lost traction. It wasnâ€™t serious or life threatening. The ground is soft and the gradient is simply steep.

I went from around 20 degrees and cool at the top, with the feeling that I should wear an extra layer to warm up. As I descended i walked from a cold season to warm.

I miss walking in the mountains. I haven't done such a walk in at least a year. It's nice to be away from cars and other machines. It's nice to be in the countryside/mountainside, in nature. I didn't spot or hear any wildlife this time but it might be because I'm louder when I'm walking than when I'm cycling. I did see two or three people cycling up. I saw one person heading up with an electric bike. It's amusing to see, because they're going much faster than you would expect on a bike to go. It looks out of place to see a bike going up those roads so quickly.

During this walk I realised how good it would feel to walk for several days or weeks in a row. I don't think that it would be wise to do so during a pandemic but I do think that it would be pleasant to do in the near future. In Europe you can walk either with, or without a tent, depending on the route. You could walk far without having to carry a few days of food with you. We'll see.
