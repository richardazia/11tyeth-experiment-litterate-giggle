I love working on my own projects, where I rely on no one but myself but occasionally I'm lucky enough to have no choice but to work with other people. It's at these moments that I learn more. I learn about team scheduling and teamwork. I also learn about delegation. I'm not that good at it yet but I'm learning. Anyone working as a producer or director needs to learn that job and some are better than others. The recent myspace and Magician audition projects I worked on saw some good producers in charge. As a result, the project was good. Recently I've had to be a co-producer with someone else and I was asked what jobs still had to be done and I had to think about it before I could delegate the responsibility. I finally found some methods of delegating responsibility, therefore, I'll have more material to choose from when it comes to editing. The project has to be finished by Monday because Tuesday I'll be back in London with a three thousand word essay on technological determinism to hand in. On the Monday following that I have a presentation on digital content. I've been thinking about that concept and I think I'll be able to produce a good product.
