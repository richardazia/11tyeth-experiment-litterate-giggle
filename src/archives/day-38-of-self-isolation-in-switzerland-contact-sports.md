By May we may be able to go back to doing sports in groups as long as they are not "contact sports" in Switzerland. For me this means hiking, running cycling and other related sports. For me climbing is a contact sport because we touch the same hand holds as everyone else climbing the routes, we use the same ropes and we share quickdraws and belay devices.

This being said I also have no desire to do sports like climbing at the moment because they require us to stand around and socialise and I haven't really socialised in at least 38 days. I need to ease back into the world of the extrovert. Hiking is a good way to do that.

### Visual Studio Code

Today I started watching a course on Linkedin learning about using Chrome for webmastering but got distracted with the idea of installing a server on my mac book pro. I then got even more distracted by Visual Studio Code.

I like this piece of software because it's free, intuitive to use and quick. A few days ago I had spent hours playing with another html editing tool and the process was so laborious that i wasted a lot of time. With Visual Studio Code it's fast and I'm getting through the task of making the old part of my website mobile friendly.

The process is interesting. The more pages I optimise the more experience I gain and the more efficient I become. I found that if I remove some bits of code the page is mobile compliant within two or three steps and I can move on to the next page, and the next one after that.

In theory these pages should always have been mobile friendly because they're light. There is no CSS or other clunk. Images are also small as bandwidth was an issue in those days. It still is, but we have a firehose rather than a syringe today.

Webmastering is great because time really flies when you're working on a website. You can easily spend ten or more hours a day working on something and still have a few more hours of work. That's why some professions look so busy compared to others. Of course it's time consuming because I am still perfecting the work flow. By the time I've optimised every page I'll be proficient at an updated skill.

### TikTok

Last night I was unable to focus so I installed TikTok and looked at plenty of videos to clear my mind enough to be able to think about dinner. I must have been in the right frame of mind because I enjoyed quite a few of the videos and flooded my facebook timeline with examples. Don't worry though, out of the flood I only got one like. It seems that no one saw the flood so it didn't happen.

### 1SE - One Second Every Day

More in character with me is the One Second Everyday app. I created a compilation for every day of quarantine so far but I won't share the video too frequently because it will be most effective when it has at least sixty more days.

That's it for today. Time to think about dinner.
