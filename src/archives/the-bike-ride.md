During a pandemic one of the safest places to be is on a bike on quiet rural roads. The only people you meet are sporty so there is a higher likelihood that they are sporty.

Today I had to be respectful when passing two horses. They can often be afraid when they see cyclists, as we look strange. Bright colours, a strange machine underneath us. It can also be that the rider is also a little afraid. I always pass or let horses pass with caution.

A few bike rides ago I was told that they get spooked when they don't know what is behind them. In this case I was in front of the horses.

I take the paths because I want to avoid dangerous roads and cars. The weather was good for cycling today.
