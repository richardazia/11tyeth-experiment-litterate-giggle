Today I had a ride towards storm clouds. I was cycling in the sun but as I looked towards Geneva I could see that it was dark and grey. I questioned whether to turn around or whether to keep going. It started to rain but I was reaching the half way point.

I didn't turn around. I continued going and I passed families or groups on their bikes going slower than me. I flew by them and then I headed down towards the lake before turning right and going through a forest road. On this forest road, I saw children and parents on the road so I had to slow down as I passed them.

During this ride, I avoided passing through Versoix because it's unpleasant. I prefer being in the countryside. I think that I spotted two people on bikes playing Pokemon Go. I assume this because they went to where I know there is an Ingress portal but it did not change.

I saw what I think was a young child and two parents start to head up a steep hill that I have found difficult to go up after some rides and thought "If that child makes it up that hill I will be impressed." I didn't slow down to see whether this was the case or not.

I haven't cycled through Nyon or any big cities yet, because I don't feel comfortable doing that for the moment. The countryside still feels like the safer place to be.
