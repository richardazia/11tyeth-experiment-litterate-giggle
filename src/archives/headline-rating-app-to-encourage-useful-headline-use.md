In future I would like an application or social network that allows me to rate headlines according to whether they are sensationalist, informative, emotional informative or other. The aim of this network or app would be to discourage article writers from re-using the same phrases over and over. It would encourage writers rather than marketers to provide headlines that article readers want to follow. I often see articles that I would find interesting but because of the way the headline is written I avoid it. I don't want to give marketers a victory for condescending to their audience. I also worry about the article's informative value. Will the article provide me with some new information or is it so general that I already know this. Articles need to provide me with a return on investment. I want to be informed, educated and entertained.
