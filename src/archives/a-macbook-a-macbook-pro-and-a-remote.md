Yesterday I was lucky enough to be asked what the remote on the new MacBook and MacBook pros were for. I went to the owner of the Macbook's room and picked up the remote. Both my machine and hers were side by side and I started to play. I was controlling both computers at once. It's not the type of thing I usually do but it's amusing. You could control quite a few more machines if you like.

For some reason they appeared to be on the same menu so I'm wondering whether there's something built in that tells them whether the remote wants video, music, DVD, or photo.
