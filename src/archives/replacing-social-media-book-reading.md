This year I am replacing Social Media with Book Reading because social media is no longer a conversational place. It has become a place for sensationalism and the spreading of fake news and emotional news. As a result of these factors the potential gain of new friendships and interesting conversations has declined. For this reason you might as well find some interesting books and broaden your horizons. \[caption id="attachment\_3412" align="aligncenter" width="300"\][![Replacing social media with book reading](http://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-Shot-2017-02-27-at-15.59.35-300x116.png)](http://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Screen-Shot-2017-02-27-at-15.59.35.png) Replacing social media with book reading\[/caption\] I currently have hundreds of books on Kindle and Audible and my collection on the Kobo reader is bound to grow. Recently I read [Too Loud A Solitude](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10797006-too-loud-a-solitude). This is a book I came across by accident. I was browsing through Goodreads recommendations and it came up. The book is interesting because it tells the story of a person who worked compacting books for 35 years. Every chapter begins with the phrase "For 35 years...". The journey is an interesting one because we see how someone with a passion for books rescues some before they are destroyed. It is worth reading when you have the interest and motivation. Another interesting book I read is [Tartarin Sur Les Alpes](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3695544-tartarin-sur-les-alpes). This book is interesting because of its age. It is about the early days of Alpinism. It speaks of various mountains and locations that are easy to get to today but that were accessed by horse and carriage at the time. It also explores the early days of tourism. Books require an investment of time of several hours in the same way that television series require. You can read a chapter or "episode" a day or you can binge through them reading several chapters in a single day. They usually require from seven to 21 hours to get through just like television series seasons. It's easy to lose entire days. I like e-books and I like audible books. As a result of this I can walk around with hundreds of books at a time and read from one book and then another. It transports me to different time periods and places. For a moment I stop living in the present. With audio books I can drive, hike or walk at the same time. I can be a bookworm without being stuck in a building. It's a shame that we don't read more.
