The games are starting at 10am Tokyo time but 3am Geneva time and it's amusing getting to work. Yesterday was really tiring as I'd been woken by workers at 7am. So far we've seen about 40 matches and Italy's defeat was a shame. We only have one match at a time but four of them in total so our day is 14hrs long. The teams today are: germany vs nigeria, US vs australia, France vs. Angola and Greece Vs. China.
