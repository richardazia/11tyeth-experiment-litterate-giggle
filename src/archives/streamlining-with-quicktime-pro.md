If you're learning about editing but don't want to spend much money then Quicktime pro is a cheap and easy straight cut editor. It's quick and easy to use. With the short cut apple+c apple+N and apple+v you have a very simple editor. Using J to play backwards, k to pause and L to play normally you control how the video plays. With the I key for marking in points and the O key for out points you've got everything you need. Find a video clip that is recognised by Quicktime and play the video. Find the footage you want to keep with the J,K,L keys and mark your in and out points. Once this is done cut the video with apple+C and open a new player with apple+n. Paste the video segment in your new player and you've got the first shot. Repeat this process with the source video and you've got a simple straight cuts editor. There was some footage I wanted to process quickly, without opening finalcut pro and it worked fine. It's more intuitive than imovie (for me at least) and it's very affordable.
