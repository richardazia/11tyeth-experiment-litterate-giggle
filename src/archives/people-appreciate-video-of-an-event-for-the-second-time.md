A few months ago I filmed the Silent Disco in Paddington station, one of London's main train stations. As a result of the coverage of the event many people were happy to see it. With the footage I have recently filmed of the events that took place on the 6th of October I am once again getting a lot of that appreciation through facebook comments. It feels good and I need to find more events to cover that will get this type of response. update:-- I'm also really looking forward to watching the trends on tubemogul as I see whether it will increase over a period of hours or a period of days. It's always fun to watch how many views you get over a period of weeks and months.
