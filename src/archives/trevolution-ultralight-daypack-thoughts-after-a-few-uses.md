If you want a bag that isn't a bag until you need it to be a bag then the [TrevolutionÂ Ultralight Daypack](https://www.galaxus.ch/de/s8/product/trevolution-ultralight-daypack-21-l-rucksack-freizeit-9927605) is a great option. I like that it folds into its bag and that it's easy to have with you at all times. What I don't like about the version I have is that it's too flimsy for daily use and the top opening is not practical. It requires both hands to open and close the main compartment.

I don't like its feel on my back during daily walks. All the wait shifts to the wrong place and the straps feel flimsy when used for one and a half to two hour daily walks. It is not for that niche.

The niches that it does fill:

*   A shopping bag for carrying your shopping to the car, instead of using plastic or paper bags
*   A book carrier, if like me you start a walk, see a lending library and pick up a book or two, but don't want to carry them home in your hands
*   A spare bag, in the car, for when you drop into shops where you're not allowed to go in with a bag. Decathlon in Paris, or Mediamarkt for example. (I write this more as a joke than as a serious comment).
*   Travel by plane or train. I like to travel with just a twenty five litre bag, which is great for the trip, but a pain to walk around with in a city. Having a small bag is great, because you don't need to empty the main bag.
*   Museums and other cultural locations: In the past I have been to events where I am told that I need to check in my bag if I want to enter. I usually don't want to. With this bag you can fold it away, into it's carrying pouch and then you're fine.
*   Conferences and events: It fits in your pocket, and if you pick things up you don't need to pick up yet another tote bag.

For at least two or three years I used a [stoke Bike 10](https://www.ochsnersport.ch/de/shop/stoke-bike-10-l-bikerucksack-schwarz-0000200171710600000001-p.html) litre bag. I used it so often, for daily walks to the shops, my daily one and a half hour walks, and more, that the zip eventually gave in. Small bags are great because you can use them for a rain coat, water and external battery to charge the phone.

Conclusion
----------

This is a backup or secondary bag. It is good to keep in the car, in the pocket of a traveling bag or a coat pocket. It is good for occasional use. If you want a bag that you can use for two hours a day on a daily basis then a proper bag is better. If I could I would swap it for the [version with a zip](https://www.galaxus.ch/en/s8/product/trevolution-ultraleichter-tages-21-l-backpack-11053165), rather than the cord to store helmets or other bulkier items. The one with a zip is 9 CHF more. There is a [Sea To Summit variant](https://www.galaxus.ch/en/s8/product/sea-to-summit-daypack-20-l-backpack-7328107?supplier=2857232).
