With the right people designing the interface it should be simpler to do things sustainably today. I think that a QR code that we can print out and add to a book with the same sticky things as for photo albums might be the best solution. A QR code takes seconds to scan and add a comment to. I should suggest that to them. I should study how to implement it.

I haven't heard of this version, but there was a similar project to Bookcrossing started maybe 10-12 years ago that I participated in heavily at the start, because I loved he idea. The book was logged on a website and you left the info in the book when you passed it on or left it in a free library or book-exchange space. Alas, though I logged all my books and tried my hardest to make it all go, it fizzled. Maybe it was just too much work for people to volunteer their time to do? Dunno. Here's to hoping this version takes off!
