Yet another episode of twittervox was recorded today at the new time of 1pm British summertime whilst outside the weather is more autumnal. Nik Butler of h and I discussed the new media landscape and how social networks in the real and virtual world were interacting together. Loudmouthman focussed his attention on social media networks and businesses whilst I took a look at the new Iphone release in the UK and how [Documentally](http://www.documentally.com) and I came to be the owners of an Itouch each. [Phil Campbell](http://www.me.dm) was also present but following a meeting with a client taking place simultaneously he was given observer status and gave us his own thoughts on the topic via feedback.
