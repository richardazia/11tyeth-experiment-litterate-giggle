One of the best features of google chrome at the moment is it's instant translation function. The idea is simple. You surf to a page, it automaticaly detects the language and then presents the content in a language you understand. With such a feature the advantage is that it opens up a whole new batch of knowledge and information. Surf to a Polish page about Kabanos, a Polish/eastern European speciality and the content is instantly available in English. As a second example if you're in Switzerland and surf to a swiss page the content may originaly be presented in English but the software will translate it. As a result there is no longer the need to hunt for that language switching part of the page. The big picture insinuates that whatever the language you speak you will be able to read the content in many more pictures. As a result language will become transparent.
