Flying over [Oeschinensee](https://www.instagram.com/explore/locations/301133235/oeschinensee/) with an FPV drone looks nice. I went there as a child and the lake is distinct with its lake, green slopes, hills and that wall of rock on the other side. It's above Kandersteg and there are a number of walks to be enjoyed in the area.

Flying a drone in such a place is great because it gives you a way of exploring the landscape either before you've been on a hike or afterwards. It also allows you to find new locations from which to take pictures or even to find a new climbing route. I haven't looked at what climbs there are around there.

I know that there is a [Via Ferrata](https://www.myswitzerland.com/fr-ch/decouvrir/via-ferrata-kandersteg-allmenalp/) that I have been tempted to do in summer. With a drone, it would be fun to get some shots from a different perspective than usual.

Instead of people on a boat, he could have found people exploring the Via Ferrata. There are some nice shots going down waterfalls, through the valley, along the river bed, through the forest and more. It's a great location for flying a drone.
