Hi Richard, I think Jaiku is not proprietary at all: although we have our own Nokia S60 client, we have also 3rd-party mobile clients for practically all the Java-enabled handsets, Blackberries, and soon also for Windows Mobile. At the moment we have more than 20 3rd-party apps built on top of our APIs, ranging from mobile clients to iGoogle gadget and OSX + Windows clients. A more complete list can be found [here](http://devku.org/projects). You can also use Jaiku via SMS and IM (IMified, soon also via our own IM bot): browser is not required, although quite a few people use Jaiku with it.
