Picasa is now available for mac and it works well. It works so well it took just 30 seconds for me to crash the application. On a more serious note Picasa is an interesting application that auto indexes all of your pictures in the Pictures folder and indexes your images within the application. As a result you have easy access to those images. At the same time as it can do those things it also makes uploading images to picasa on the web, to blogger e-mail and more. What I like most about this application is it's ability to read geotags to place images on the map both locally and on the website. The weakness though is that it's per album for the moment, rather than for every image at once. It would be fun to see all my images from around here scattered on the map.
