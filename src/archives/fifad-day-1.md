### FIFAD Day 1

From the 6th to the 13th of August 2016 The International Alpine Film Festival, [FIFAD](http://www.fifad.ch/jour-par-jour-2015), is taking place in the Alpine town of [Les Diablerets](http://www.diablerets.ch/en/index.cfm). This is a week long festival of Alpine films covering the environment, extreme sports, adventure and more.

### Alpland

Alpland is a photo exhibit outside of images of Alpine life in black and white. The images were taken by Romano Riedo

### The Flying Frenchies arrive

The image gallery below shows the [Flying Frenchies](https://www.flying-frenchies.com/) arrive at the film festival. The drummer flew with his drum kit, the guitarist flew with a guitar and amp and the saxophonist arrived with his instrument. They played their instruments while up in the air. Watching this in person is interesting. \[gallery ids="3253,3252,3251,3250,3249,3248,3247,3246,3245,3244"\]

### Metronomic

Baraka Films and the Flying Frenchies worked togetherÂ for this fun and entertaining film. This film looks at the Flying Frenchies coming together to combine slack-lining, parapentes and other extreme sports with musicians. The Flying Frenchies arrived at the event on parapentes.The film metronomic shows cliff based stunts. It combines acrobatics on a cliff face with slack-lining and rope based stunts. At one point the guitarist, the drummer and the Saxophonist are swinging in space and playing at the same time.

### The Freeride evening

The evening was dedicated to freeride sports, mainly extreme skiing and a discussion with the Falquet brothers and JÃ©rÃ©mie Heitz. One of the images that really marked me was the climb up to a pyramidal peak so that they could ski back down. The reason they climb rather than use a helicopter is to assess how good the snow is and whether it is safe to sky down. Some of these films had some impressive images, including at least one unsuccessful descent. The films on this dayÂ showed the beauty of extreme sports both with skiing slopes that are over 50Â° as well as with flying musicians. As people get habituated to certain sports so the scope for diversity and creativity expands.
