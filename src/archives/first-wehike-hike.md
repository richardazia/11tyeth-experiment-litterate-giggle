Wehike is a website dedicated to find people with whom to hike. People can contribute hikes to wehike and then they or other people can organise events based on the hike information. This includes a GPX file and images. At the moment this site is in beta so they are looking for user feedback. At the moment they are based in Switzerland but they will be able to expand globally as people contribute hikes and other people participate in these hikes. I liked [yesterday's hike](http://www.sports-tracker.com/workout/warzabidul/590628bf205b9b0e49d060d5) because for once I was struggling to keep up with the group rather than the opposite. Usually I'm leading the group and stopping every so often to take pictures and because I'm not certain of which fork to take next. In this case they were waiting for me. This is in part due to the Via Ferrata de Saillon trip the day before. I'll get back to being in front of the group and taking pictures soon.

Apparently twenty five centimetres of snow fell the day before. As a result one local recommended that we choose another route than the one we had planned on. We decided instead to see how the conditions were. As is the case when you go for hikes in Spring the damage from winter has not being cleared away. We found trees and branches on the paths and paths that would normally be clear to find required more instinct and orientation than average.

We stopped at the ruin for a snack/lunch. From this point you walk up steep paths near the field's age with a river to your right until you get to a clearing. From the clearing you walk up some more and you get towards the vista below.

If you continue to the Cap au Moine then you still have some climbing to do. Due to the deep snow and conditions this is the point at which we started heading back down. We walked along in 20-30 centimetre snow falling someone's snowshoe traces and then headed down.

You can run and jump down the hill. I would share the photos if I had the participants' permission. Here's a taste.

Eventually you get back to the grass and the tree line. When you get back down to the river you cross a stone bridge and to the right you see a waterfall pictured below.

We also got to walk a steep hill in the snow and run and bound down a snowy slope without worrying. Snow is so much softer for the knees. I would like to redo the hike later in the season when the snow has gone.
