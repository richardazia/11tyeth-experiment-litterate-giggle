The next two weeks or so shall see me resting but not from media work. There's a good chance I'll be working on a project about a Prison in the Lebanon. It was shot a few weeks ago and the person in charge of the project needs help with the editing. It looks as though it's going to be an interesting project. I've already viewed quite a bit of footage, read the voice over text and discussed the idea. I've started to form some ideas of how to create the story and tomorrow this should progress further with me going in to work. In around two weeks I'll have an interesting work shift, from 5am to 1300 hours, in other words my work day will be finished when other people get their work day started. We'll see how that goes anyway. Ciao for now
