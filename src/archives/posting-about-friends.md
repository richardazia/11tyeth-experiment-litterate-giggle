When people write about friends should they post their twitter profile page or the websites their friends are working on. I'm asking this question because whilst reading a post today I was interested in the ability to follow these friends and see what they're up to rather than read the website. Reading a twitterstream is quick. 140 Characters are read almost instantly and adding someone that sounds interesting is instantaneous. As a resultÂ  I'm far more likely to follow and read a person's blog if there's a consistant reminder both of what they're doing and who they are as a person. It's about time. I'm a scanner. I scan through content rather than trudge through it. If you're linking to twenty people and you link to twenty blogs then there's no way I'm going to have the time to read all this content. I'd saturate extraordinarily quickly.Â  Following another person on twitter takes seconds to do and I'll track these people. Point me to a blog and there's a chance I won't take the time to look. Has anyone had a similar reaction to twitter vs. blogs? Do you write about a group of friends, all of whom have twitter accounts? If so have you linked to their blogs or to their twitter profiles?
