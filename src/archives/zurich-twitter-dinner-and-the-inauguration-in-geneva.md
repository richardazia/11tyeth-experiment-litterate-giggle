For the moment I am planning on going to Zurich for the twitter dinner. It's the first [Zurich twitter event](http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=64207280128) I go to and it will be interesting whether I need to speak swiss german or whether my English and French will help make conversation a little simpler. I don't exchange messages with many Zurich twitter users so it will be quite different from the London events where I had exchanged so many messages. There's another one in a month's time in Paris although with the label I don't enjoy much. I like the word tweetup because you have to smile to say it. Video of the event may arrive online. As a side note I should be going to one of the Geneva Inauguration event to get some footage of how the international community/facebook users of Geneva react to the event.
