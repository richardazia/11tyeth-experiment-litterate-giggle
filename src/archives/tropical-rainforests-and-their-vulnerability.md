### The Threats and Losses:

#### How much?

*   Rainforests once covered 14 percent of the Earth's land surface, now they cover 6 percent and experts estimate that the last remaining rainforests could be consumed in less than 40 years.
    *   Globally 2.4 (1 hectare) acres of rainforest have been destroyed every second... it is the equivalent of two US football fields put together.
    *   149 acres (60 hectares) have been destroyed a minute.
    *   214,000 acres (86,000) per day: an area larger than NYC.
    *   78 million acres (31 million hectares per year: an area larger than Poland.
    *   In Brazil an estimation of 5.4 million acres have been destroyed per year. (estimate averaged for period 1979-1990)

#### Why?

*   Rainforests are being destroyed because the value of this land is perceived as only the value of it's timber by short sighted governments, multi-national logging companies and land owners.
*   Commercial logging => teak, mahogany, rosewood etc.... for furniture, building materials, charcoal for big businesses and big profits. Comaines: Texaco, Mitsubishi corp. Unocoal...
*   Governments and their development of natural resources. control 805 of rainforests
*   National debt=> World Bank
*   Logging rainforest timber => $$large economic resource
*   Composition of the soil, nutrients are locked up in the trees, less than 10% of the Amazonian soils are suitable for agriculture.
*   subsistence farming
*   "squatter's rights"
*   cattle ranching
*   mining
*   oil extraction
*   hydroelectric dams

#### Consequences?

*   The loss of tropical rainforests may lead to devastating world impact, rainforests are so biologically diverse

*   consider this:

*   Consider this.
    *   A single pond in Brazil can sustain a greater variety of fish than are found in all of Europe's rivers;
    *   over 2000 species of fish have been identified in the Amazon Basin - more species than the entire Atlantic ocean.
    *   a 25 acre plot of rainforest in Borneo may contain over 700 species of trees - a number equal to the total tree diversity of North America.
    *   A single rainforest reserve in Peru is home to more species of birds than the entire United States.
    *   One single tree in Peru was found to harbor 43 different species of ants - a total that approximates the entire species of the British Isles.
*   The biodiversity of the tropical rainforest e.g.: less than 1% of it's millions of species have been studied by scientists for possible uses by man. Scientific experts estimate loss of 137 species of plants, animals and insects everyday.
*   consequences are air/water pollution, soil erosion, malaria epidemics, release of carbon dioxide, eviction of tribes, loss of bio-diversity and of species becoming extinct.
*   Carbon dioxide entering the atmosphere from fires and rotting vegetation may lead to an increase in global warming.
