There's so much hype about friendfeed because of it's features but that's something jaiku has been doing for months and months now. It's a shame that silicon valley doesn't look beyond their borders. Shame the hype is almost always around that part of the world. The more I use jaiku the more I enjoy it. If anyone wants some invites I should have a few left. Just let me know and I'll send you an invite.
