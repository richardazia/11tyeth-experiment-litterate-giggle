var so = new SWFObject('/jw/embed/player.swf','mpl','640','352','9'); so.addParam('allowscriptaccess','always'); so.addParam('allowfullscreen','true'); so.addParam('flashvars','&file=http://www.main-vision.com/richard/video/Nyonfeb.flv'); so.write('player'); Today I went down to the Nyon Lakeside to play with the camera to try it out. I watched the video playback and it looked fine. I saw some pixelation between a girl's face and her hair when she was walking and some artefacts just around the people's bodies as they move. That's at 1440\*1020, not full resolution. I'll have to find time to do test at full HD quality during my days off. Please note that for monitoring I was using a 40" Sony Bravia and standing a few centimeters away. From a few meters back it looked fine.
