Today I was pleasantly surprised after racketing in the mountains to discover that my phone's battery had not depleted. I was using sportstracker for over two hours and some charge was still left after an hour and a half. There was so much battery left in fact I went for nine more kilometers of walking and still the battery is healthy. That's not the only thing that's improved. Now you have maps. You can't move around the map except by changing geographic location but you can see the roads around you and more. It's much simpler than google maps but then again there's no need for such accuracy anyway. Now I can spend half a day walking and still have enough power to be tracked the whole way. I know, half a day isn't that long. Still better than an hour or two though.
