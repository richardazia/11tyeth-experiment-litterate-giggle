> You see, 3G is the golden goose for wireless carriers. Itâ€™s technology that turns their networks from boring voice systems to multi-functional data systems. Theyâ€™re going from being a diner offering three specials/day to a restaurant with a huge buffet. This buffet is enticing and offers something for pretty much everyone but youâ€™ll have to pay for it.

Too disruptive, too many factors to take into consideration. Looking forward to when the golden goose has de-valued data to such a point it's as cheap as broadband has become.
