[Minsh](http://minsh.net/) is launching tomorrow and I will be meeting with them to record an interview with them about the website. They're university students who did this as one of their projects. Minsh is a 3d virtual environment in which twitter users are represented as fish swimming in the ocean. Each fish is a different twitter user. I saw this project in pre alpha and it's an interesting idea. Tomorrow I will see how it's evolved and I hope to have a video up by Friday lunchtime which will help you understand what the website is about.
