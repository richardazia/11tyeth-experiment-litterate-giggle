[![unfollow](http://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/unfollow-300x150.jpeg)](http://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/unfollow.jpeg)Twitter is a dynamic and social conversation tool which ignores borders, timezones and continents. The more time you give to the website the more you get out of it. As more and more people join the site so following passive people makes less and less sense. Yesterday I downloaded justunfollow out of curiosity and today they come out with updated iOS and Android apps.
