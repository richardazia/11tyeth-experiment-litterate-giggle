This video is interesting because of it's demonstration of how well the Sony A7S copes with low light conditions. This was filmed with moonlight rather than daylight. We see the details in the snow tracks and we see the snow. We need to see some more night riding but in a city or in the countryside where existing light is sparse. I look at the detail of the snow which is crisp but I also notice the lack of detail in the clothes worn by the riders. I would like to see this camera tested in a cave where the only light source is a helmet light. It expands the shooting day. It means that when night comes you take an opportunity to get more footage. Imagine using this technology in the arctic circle where the sun does not rise for more than a few minutes a day or when night lasts for a few days or weeks at a time. It means Â that you can film arctic wildlife during an extended period of time.

> We tested **usable** dynamic range of the given cameras. With 12Â stops the usable dynamic range of the A7S comes surprisingly close to the [Arri Amira](https://tr.green-affiliate.de/r/?eJwrtjK0sFIyMzHXTUnVNbMw0zU2Ndc1srBQsgYAUt0F0w%3D%3D&deeplink=/en/products/cat_663/detail_6261.htm) (13.1 stops) with its legendary Alexa sensor ([see our full review here](https://www.cinema5d.com/working-with-the-arri-amira-review-part-2/)).

It would be interesting to see the camera tested in high contrast conditions, for example in valleys or gorges where part of the scene is in the shade and part of it is in the sun. Towns are also an interesting place to see how good the camera is at dealing with high dynamic ranges.
