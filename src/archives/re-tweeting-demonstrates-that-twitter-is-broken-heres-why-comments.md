I agree that Twitter can often be frustrating and time wasting. I hate having to search through people's Tweets to catch the start of a conversation. But in a way it's strangely fascinating, like maybe you shouldn't be reading it...  
  
I do like Friendfeed a lot but find it almost impossible to get my local active group of Twitter people to use it. I post stuff on there and it just goes into a void. No-one follows you on Friendfeed (except yourself, maybe Scoble) and it feels a bit one sided. I want to use it more though so I'm not going to give up.It will catch on more in Europe but it's going to take time.

That's the reason for which I never really used jaiku, felt to once sided. Since writing that article I've been busy with other things so not using friendfeed that much. That one sided feeling does change from time to time.
