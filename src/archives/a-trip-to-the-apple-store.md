Playing with technology is fun especially when you could fit it into your shirt pocket. The ipod s one such device. it fits easily into the pocket and can play video, allow for the viewing of photos and more. I also like the user interface, whether the fact the screen is split into text on the left and images on the right or the ability to search through songs and such. Two of it's disadvantages are the small click wheel. Whilst easy to get used to it may leave some people with broader fingers slightly frustrated. Another flaw is that when video is dark there's no image. It's only good for normally lit subjects. That's a shame since you're always in the mood for Film noire on the tube. The ipod classic has a newer user interface than the ipod I'm using at the moment and the search option is there. The most interesting feature is still the size of the hard driveÂ  in relation to the device. I'd like to get a nano because it's so small that for a night out it's more appropriate than the classic but the classic is interesting when you're in need of a data backup of your laptop for example. My laptop drive is the same as the larger classic so theoretically it'd be a good alternative. Of course small drives are more fragile so less dependable over time.
