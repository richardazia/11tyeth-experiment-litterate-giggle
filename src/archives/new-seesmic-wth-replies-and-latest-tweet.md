The latestÂ  version of Seesmic was rolled out this evening during the Demo Presentation by Loic Lemeur and amongst it's newest features are replies counters so that you can see how many people reacted, a latest tweet display and faster loading times for the pages. There is an active conversations tab in the lower right corner and the shows tab has been replaced by a replies tab. The site is far slicker and easier to use. Great changes.
