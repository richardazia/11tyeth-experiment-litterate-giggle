Today I went for my first flight with the [DJI Mini SE](https://www.galaxus.ch/en/s1/product/dji-dji-mini-se-fly-more-combo-30-min-249-g-12-mpx-drone-18608847) and it feels very familiar, after flying a spark so frequently, until I crashed that drone. I would have replaced the spark but I didn't because it would either cost two thirds to replace the old one, or cost a lot to buy a new drone, with batteries and the rest of the gear. I waited. I didn't wait for four weeks, four months, or four seasons. I waited for two years, until I saw the DJI Mini SE was about to come out.

What I like about this drone is first and foremost its price, but also its form factor. In Europe drones that way more than 250 grams have stricter rules than drones below 250 grams, so with a small light drone, you can fly in more places. The other advantage is that you can go for a two hour walk, without ever been bothered by the weight. I know because that's what I did today.

Another nice feature is that the [DJI Mini SE Flymore](https://www.galaxus.ch/en/s1/product/dji-dji-mini-se-fly-more-combo-30-min-249-g-12-mpx-drone-18608847) pack comes with a three battery charger spare props, and a carrying case. Everything fits neatly into the carrying case, and the carrying case fits nicely into a 10 litre hiking bag.

With the DJI spark it was a pain because the charger was large and needed to be transported in one case. In another case I had the drone and three batteries and because batteries were good for just 20 minutes you had to have a few. In the end it was a pain to keep everything charged and ready. Thinks have improved over the last three or four years.

If you crash this drone, and break one of it's arms you can unscrew the broken arm and replace it, without replacing the entire body. Repair-ability is important with something that can get stuck and fall from a tree onto a tarmac road, as mine did.

And finally, I have flown just once for about 15 minutes and I feel a little rusty. It feels just the same as the Spark, but maybe a little slower. I notice that between telling it to go full forward to full backwards there is a little control lag. I would consider getting a landing mat, for when landing in grass. With the Spark if you tried to start it near grass it would behave like a lawnmower. This one tells you there is a motor error. I took off from the edge of a farm road. I had good visibility and could see cars if they were approaching.

That's it for now. I will update you as I learn more
