Today I went to the Geneva Motor Show and filmed lot's of cars, from the Koenigsegg to Asimo the robot via a few girls giving information about cars and even crowds of people. I spent some time reviewing the footage and yet again I'm happy with the results. I'm going to work on a few compilation videos within the next few days but if you'd like an overview of the result then I have a sample on [blip](http://www.blip.tv/file/1871495?filename=Warzabidul-GenevaMotorshowInHD788.flv) (select the mov), and on Youtube (Select HD). Enjoy.
