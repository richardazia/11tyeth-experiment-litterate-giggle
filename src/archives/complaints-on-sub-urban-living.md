I would love to go back to the countryside where I can sleep whenever I choose and wake up when I can. I love being around people, going out and partying but I also love being able to sleep and waking up to the sound of silence. It's been hard these past few weeks with all the work I've been doing in the academic sphere. I would go to sleep between 10pm and midnight were it not for the drunks making noise till 3am and the cleaners and others making noise from 9am onwards. Six hours to sleep is plenty of sleep... theoretically. When you're woken by the sound of others though and prevented from sleeping by the sound of some then the countryside's pull is really strong. I'm day dreaming of getting out of the suburbs. They're the worst of bost world. They're crap because everyone commutes into town for work yet they're not deep enough in the countryside to allow for the freedom to walk for hours without interruptions. I want silence. I'm exhausted at the moment, longing for nothing more than a full week of sleep cycles where nothing but my mind wake me up. The villager in me is stronger than the urbanite and that's clearly visible.
