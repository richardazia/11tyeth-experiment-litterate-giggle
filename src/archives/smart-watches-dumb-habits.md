When I wore Casio digital watches, Suunto Dive computers, Suunto GPS watches and other wrist wathces I was happy. You wore it and it tracked what you wanted it to track, from walks, to dives, to altitude changes, weather and more. With the Apple watch a new age emerged. The age of the Digital Watch as object of addiction. I don't like the term addiction, but I use it for simplicity.

The Suunto Spartan Wrist HR I have tracks all day activity and I didn't mind. It tracked it in the background but didn't nag you to do more, or to get up every hour. You just got along with your life until you ended your workout and wanted to see a GPS track.

With Fitbit and with Apple watches you have the same invasive habit. Walk 250 steps an hour, stand for one minute every hour. They nag you. As if that wasn't enough they also nag you to wash your hands for 20 seconds, and more. The Apple watch is too invasive to be pleasant.

One of my biggest frustrations is that although we have one phone each device now has an app, and the apps don't speak to each other so you have to choose whether to wear watch A for App A, Watch B for app B or Watch C for app c. All of that data is centralised on Apple or Android devices but it doesn't jump between them so you are forced to make a choice.

If you skip wearing one instead of the other you have a gap in daily data and this bugs me. I went from wearing a GPS watch to track workouts on weekends and evenings to wearing watches 24 hours a day, that all want you to be loyal 24 hours a day to have complete data.

For me to be happy every watch should be able to send the data from the watch to the app, and from the app to the phone, and from that phone to every other app. By putting the data in silos they force loyalty, but by forcing loyalty they tempt me to stop tracking steps, heart rate sleep and other things. They tempt me to wear a simple watch except for my daily walks.
