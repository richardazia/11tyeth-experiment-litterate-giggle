Ordinarily you see pictures of cows standing up looking towards the camera but occassionaly people like me walk by cows when they are on their chewing the cud break. They lie around and slouch. It's amusing to see three cows in close proximity like this. They have their eyes closed, their legs out. Are you used to seeing such scenes?

Cows in Switzerland have a good life. They head from the valleys to the top of mountains, eat grass, and then have siestas in the middle of the day. Their quality of life is good. Not all cows are the life and soul of the hike.

The Convivial Life Of Cows

I didn't know that as adults they would rest their heads on each other.
