Any french speaker knows this frustration. You see that a new service is available to Switzerland, drop by the site and everything is in German. Google latitude is in German and hundreds of other sites too. The most recent site to suffer from this curse is Nokia music, recently made available in Switzerland. It would seem that those in charge of marketing in Switzerland believe that people in Switzerland only speak German. French speakers exist too, and so do the Italian speakers. As web content creators maybe it's time for you to offer us the services in French so that we may use them. Will companies providing services in Switzerland ever realise we're not all German speakers? That remains to be seen. Nokia music, you've lost my interest.
