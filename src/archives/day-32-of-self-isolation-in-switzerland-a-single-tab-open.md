I have a single tab open in Chrome at the moment, my main browser. This window, to write this blog post. We are now in Day 32 of self-isolation and I'm keeping myself distracted through blogging, making webpages mobile friendly and more. I'm also limiting the time I spend on news websites, social media and more. I have a five minute time limit on social media apps on my phones.

I wanted to write a Facebook post while on the escalators to go shopping but couldn't because i was already up to the limit for today. Pandemics are funny because they end up being really boring. You can walk, you can run, you can river walk and you can cycle, but if you have technical issues you need to find a way home. You also need to creatively find routes that people are less likely to follow. People are discovering my snickets so I need to be more and more creative.

It would be so nice to get into the car and go somewhere but for now that idea is absurd. We have to wait for the right time. A few more weeks of nice weather and then, when the rain comes, we can start spending time outdoors again. I write this as a joke. It would suck if we did see that happen.

From the 27th of April onwards people will be able to get their hair cut again, and to make it easier, people will be able to leave their children at kindergartens. On the 27th of April normal shops will be allowed to reopen and on the 11th of May children will go back to school. That's if every step goes smoothly of course. In another article they mentioned that exams in Switzerland will be in August.

Poor teenagers, spending their summer holidays studying for exams. Does this mean they will head to university a month later?

When speaking with a neighbour/teacher two days ago he told me that some children and their parents went to secondary homes in France and other questions so the question is how will they get from their secondary homes back to Switzerland in order to start lessons on the required day? Is returning to Switzerland seen as a legitimate reason to drive over big distances?

Un été blanc et sec attend les festivaliers
===========================================

> Annulations Historique! Paléo, Montreux Jazz, Caribana, la Cité… Les grands rendez-vous prévus d’ici fin juillet devraient tirer la prise de leur édition 2020.

This summer may be one of the quietest in decades or even centuries. There is a chance that all of the music festivals will be cancelled for this summer. In one article I read that, if so many countries are still in lockdown then it isn't worth going on a tour, as a band for just a few gigs.

The risk of forest fires is now severe enough for fires to be banned.

Although it feels like we're nearing the end of the pandemic we can see that it's still a month or more away, so our current lifestyle will have to be resilient enough to carry us through.

Time for a walk. See you later.
