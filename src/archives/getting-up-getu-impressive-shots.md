Getting up Getu is short documentary climbing video about Alex Honnold and Felipe Camargo climbing a beautiful roof climb. The most spectacular aspect of this video is the size of the arch that they are climbing. In two or three shots you see the size of the rock formations compared to the climbers. The people look tiny. The rock formations that droop down from the ceiling look interesting. The climbing at this location ranges from 5a to 9c according to one source I skimmed through. There are 250 routesÂ to choose from so this is ideal for a great number of climbers. This was the [2011 location for the Pezl Roctrip](https://www.petzl.com/event/sport/roctrip/2011-china?language=en#.V5zQ-pN96GQ). Getu looks like a beautiful area in china with interesting rock formations, arches and much more. The video below provides you with a glimpse of what else there is to see in this region. It is in the Guizhou province of china and the nearby city is [Anshun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anshun).

> It's kind of like one big double-edged _Jian_. On the one hand, the country is somewhat of a political and economic threat to the United States and our international prosperity. But on the other, it has the Getu Valley, a dramatic stomping ground of limestone cliffs and arch formations that promise to enrapture even the most seasoned spidermen and monkey boys.

According to a [CNN article](http://edition.cnn.com/2016/07/06/travel/china-guizhou-getu-river/index.html) climbers have been enjoying this location for generations. As I explored this topic further, to find video or more detailed information I came across this:

> Dangling from slippery cave walls 100 meters up from the floor below, Luo Dengping maneuvers across the steep rocks and crags in a dramatic high-wire climbing act to the amazement of spectators below. Luo, known locally as "Spiderwoman", is the only female member of a troupe of climbers who entertain visitors to the Getu River Scenic area in Guizhou, with their death-defying acts of high-altitude bravery on a daily basis.

If I find some videos of traditional climbing from this site I will share them at a later date.
