I am currently working towards a goal and I am struggling. I am struggling to stay focused when I follow online courses because I find that my mind strays. I am also struggling because the topic is so broad that there are hundreds of things you can learn but you need to be focused.

I am also struggling because although many people live in denial about the pandemic it is still thriving. The positivity check, for a disease, to be considered under control is less than five percent. COVID, after five years is still at ten or more percent. This gets in the way of going to conferences, meetups and other networking opportunities.

Out of pandemic I would volunteer for many events for two reasons. The first is that I'm shy, and by volunteering I force myself to go to events. The second reason is price. If you volunteer you pay for the train or parking but nothing else. This is a good way of going to conferences, meeting people, and coming across interesting ideas.

If I felt comfortable with what I am learning at the moment I would spend four or more hours a day on it. I would spend two hours in the morning and two hours in the afternoon.

Recently my progress keeps stalling because I don't have the solitude that I need to be at my most productive. I sit down, start to focus and then noise interrupts what I am working on and I stall.

This isn't an uncommon problem. Usually writers complain about this but I am not a writer.

What I find hard with this situation is that I am a good worker, when I am in contract. The problem is that contracts are hard to find and they end after six to nine months, and finding the next one is a struggle. That's why I'm working on changing career. That's why I try to write at least a few lines of code every day. At the moment I am working on being at ease with Laravel and PHP and it's progressing.

The progress is not as fast as I'd like, because I don't have as much solitude as I would like to make good progress.

I am close to reaching my goal.
