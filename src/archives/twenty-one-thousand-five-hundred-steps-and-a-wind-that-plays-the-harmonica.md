Today I could have taken the scooter to some shops but I went for a walk. The result of that walk is that I reached twenty one thousand five hundred steps. I often take a lot of steps per day. I wish I was walking somewhere more interesting than in circles.

According to Sports tracker my daily workouts saved 4.74 kilograms of CO2 this month.

I was amused during this walk. The wind is so strong at the moment that as I tried to play the Harmonica as I walked into the wind I found that the wind itself was playing my harmonica. If I blew then I won, but if I drew then I was competing against the wind. Boring people get wind chimes. I think that people should get harmonicas instead of wind chimes. Wind chimes are audio kitsch. Harmonicas are not, because they're rarer.

This recording is from yesterday's walk in the wind rather than today's. The audio was recorded from the airpods, I think. I wasn't sure you would hear the harmonica over the sound of the wind but it worked.

The wind has to be going at, at least, 25km/h if I remember correctly for the reeds to resonate enough to make noise.

In other news I have read more than once that [trawlers are now trawling for krill](https://divernet.com/scuba-news/krill-trawlers-cut-through-fin-whale-megapod/) within superods of whales. I read a few days ago about how fishermen are hoovering the sea of krill to feed farmed salmon. Humans are destroying the sea to such a degree that they are now hoovering up krill, leading to whales and other mammals to starve. We should not be wasting money and fuel to farm something in a juvenile state. It's bad enough that humans destroy other parts of the marine food chain but this is a step too far.

As a diver people always asked "But what is there to see when you dive" and the truth is "nothing, because of overfishing, in Swiss lakes and the mediterranean. The paradox is that with a marine reserve aquatic life comes back and thrives quite easily. People fly to Fiji and other locations to see plenty of fish but if Europeans, and others, worked to preserve their marine diversity, through marine parks then we would have more fish to see underwater. The marine eco-system needs us to leave it alone, to recover, so that fish reach maturity, so that we see large whales, fish and more.
