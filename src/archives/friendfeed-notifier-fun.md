Now that twitter has gone mainstream and fewer people are obsessive about it I've been trying to walk the gang plank and arrived on friendfeed. It's an rss aggregating site, much like facebook where you have none of your friends, but don't worry. You can populate it with various news rss sources for colour. That's not the reason for this blog post. What I wanted to really tell you about is the [friendfeed notifier](http://friendfeed.com/settings/notifier) thing. It's a useful application that shows you the latest item transiting through your home friendfeed feed in real time. As a result you can work on other projects whilst occasionaly seeing what is happening there.
