  \[caption id="attachment\_3100" align="aligncenter" width="660"\][![Summer Nyon](http://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/P1050995-1024x576.jpg)](http://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/P1050995.jpg) Summer Nyon\[/caption\] This is an image of Nyon on a day when the thermometer indicated at least 31Â°c on a sunny Sunday afternoon. In this image you can see the CGN boat leaving Nyon and heading towards Geneva. You can see the Jet D'eau in the background. You can see a sailing boat in the distance, some kayakers nearby and two pedalos. What you don't see in this image are the people playing volleyball, other people sitting at Nyon Plage or yet more people at the Nyon Swimming Pool. From Nyon you can cycle along the lake road to Geneva or Lausanne and if you feel you have the stamina you could cycle from Nyon to Nyon by taking the long way around. This may take 10 hours depending on your level of fitness and endurance. If this does not tempt you then you could go up to the Jura. You can either go up towards La DÃ´le and choose one of three routes to get to the doppler radar or you could go to St Cergue and walk from that side to the peak. The walk is short but physical so make sure to take appropriate shoes and something to drink. If those options do not tempt you then you can catch the boat you see in the image above or the smaller boat that you see below. These boats are regular. People like to take the boat from Nyon to Yvoire, have lunch, dinner or an ice cream and then come back. If you have the right friends then you could do this trip on a sailing boat as we used to do frequently with one friend. \[caption id="attachment\_3102" align="aligncenter" width="660"\][![CGN boat](http://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/P1050991-1024x576.jpg)](http://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/P1050991.jpg) CGN boat\[/caption\] Nyon has quite a few activities to distract people in summer so if you're in the region there are a few events and activities to choose from.
