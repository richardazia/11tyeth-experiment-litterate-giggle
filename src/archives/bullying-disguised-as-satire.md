We're in the middle of a pandemic. Some of us go without conversing with people in the real world for days or even weeks at a time. Is now the time to be offensive about people's social media habits? For plenty of TikTok users, their only window into the social world is their phone.

Plenty of people are lonely, and in need of human connections. Social media is a great means by which to have moments of intimacy, to flirt or even just to have a convivial moment with someone else.

If we're going to behave like bullies then it would make sense to comment on the people who do not wear a mask, and those who do not respect the two meter distance. How about all those people going to bars, restaurants and pubs where there is no respect for the two meter rule?

During a pandemic the behaviour that is harmful to society is that which spreads COVID-19, not instagramming or TikToking, or other. If people are dealing with the solitude of a pandemic by socialising online welcome, and thank them.

Their behaviour will cut the pandemic short, at least in some cases. Solitude is a positive, during a pandemic.

Never forget that just because you're married, with children, or living in an apartment with others, that this is a reality for everyone. Remember that we're six months into this pandemic and that some of us have yet to give a hug or even shake the hand of a stranger.

Pandemics are solitary affairs, so give "influencers" the benefit of the doubt.
