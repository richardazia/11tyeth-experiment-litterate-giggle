I have to use whatsapp for the group of people who live in the same building as me, but other than that my use has stopped. If we were out of pandemic I would meet new people, and I would encourage them to use other platforms than WhatsApp. Due to the pandemic I haven't had the opportunity to say "I prefer this option, to that one." One day...

I hear you. I refuse to use WhatsApp and only have FB and IG accounts for business requirements (which I would happily jettison)--and I don't have their apps on my phone, logging in via the business console only and only via my desktop (with lots of privacy walls built in--but still). I feel what you're saying about the exclusion that comes with telling people they can't find you on one of these apps--particularly WhatsApp here in Europe. I tell people they can find me on Skype or on Signal, and some are fine with that, and others say they'll just e-mail me. It can be a bit of a downer, but at the same time, I figure it separates wheat from chaff, and we all have a lot of noise in our lives, anyway. If someone doesn't value a connection with me enough to contact me via anything but WhatsApp, even if it's a tad less convenient for them to do so, then it probably it perfectly fine that we don't really take up contact.
