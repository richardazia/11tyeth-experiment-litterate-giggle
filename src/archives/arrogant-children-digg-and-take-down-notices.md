There is a copy and paste culture on the web and I don't like it. When you go to Digg, to Youtube, to myspace and other websites what you find are short comments. They're contributing nothing to the debate, in fact they make the online experience online less enjoyable. There has been quite a vocal outcry from certain people about the HD DVD codec and how forcing articles to be pulled down and deleting user accounts was going against their user rights. In fact, there is nothing of the sort. It was nice to see that these users would be held accountable for the content they link to and provide. Adding fuel to the fire Kevin Rose said something in his blog to the effect that since so many people feel so strongly about this issue he would not pull down any more links. I don't agree with this. There's a level of mob rule which I think is counterproductive. There's all this talk about user-generated content and networking. Ok. Where's the original and innovative content. Simply digging a story and putting a few remarks is not enough. Do some journalism, do some research, learn the topic inside out and then post an informed opinion. I'm not going to be part of sites where accountability is irrelevant. It's irresponsible for them to publish such information. It's also given a massive PR boost to Digg.
