[![Waiting for planes to land](http://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_20160827_172632-169x300.jpg)](http://www.main-vision.com/richard/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_20160827_172632.jpg) I prepared aÂ 360 Video of planes landing at Geneva International Airport yesterday afternoon. Watching planes land, especially when you're right underneath them just as they're about to touch down is a lot of fun. You see the lights in the distance and slowly those lights approach. There is a point after which everything speeds up and the sound gets louder. The plane flies right over you and you see the landing gear, the engines and you see the plane correct as the wind buffets it from side to side. You see it skew and then you're turning around very quickly and you watch it land. With a conventional camera or tripod this is a challenge to film because tripods are designed to pan and tilt but not in this manner. If you wanted to film landings from the position I was in you would need to build a rig that tilts up and then when the plane is directly overhead swivels and then tilts back down. With a conventional tripod this takes practice to get right. 360 cameras are an interesting alternative for camera operators because rather than move the camera it is the viewer that changes the direction in which he is looking. He watches the plane approach, looks up as it flies overhead and then swivels around to see it touch down.  I filmed 18 landings. Some of the aircraft are A-320s and others are private jets. I would have liked to get one of the A-340s that lands at Geneva but I was not that lucky. When viewing this footage I notice that the underside of the aircraft is dark. When you watch this in person then you see a lot of detail which the camera was unable to pick up. I look forward to when we can film 360 videos with full control of the device.
