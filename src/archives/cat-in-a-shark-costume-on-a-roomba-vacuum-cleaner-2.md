Shark week is here and along with it so the opportunity for shark videos to appear arrives. In one case a cat apparently likes traveling around rooms on a roomba while wearing a shark costume. Why a cat would wear a shark costume is one question. The second is how you get the costume on the cat. It's a cat after all. They're known for their personality after all. Â  And if that wasn't enough look at this chick and how he behaves.
